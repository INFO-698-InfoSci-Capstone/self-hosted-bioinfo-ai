## Summary
The [DNA methylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/dna-methylation "Learn more about DNA methylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") levels of certain [CpG sites](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cpg-site "Learn more about CpG sites from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are thought to reflect the pace of human aging. Here, we developed a robust predictor of mouse biological age based on 90 CpG sites derived from partial blood DNA [methylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/methylation "Learn more about methylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") profiles. The resulting clock correctly determines the age of mouse cohorts, detects the longevity effects of [calorie](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/calorie "Learn more about calorie from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") restriction and [gene knockouts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/gene-knockout "Learn more about gene knockouts from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and reports rejuvenation of fibroblast-derived iPSCs. The data show that mammalian DNA [methylomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/methylome "Learn more about methylomes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are characterized by CpG sites that may represent the organism’s biological age. They are scattered across the genome, they are distinct in human and mouse, and their [methylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/methylation "Learn more about methylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") gradually changes with age. The clock derived from these sites represents a biomarker of aging and can be used to determine the biological age of organisms and evaluate interventions that alter the rate of aging.

## Introduction
Organisms age at different rates, which are influenced by genotype, environment, and [stochastic processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/stochastic-process "Learn more about stochastic processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Dietary, pharmacological, and [genetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/genetics "Learn more about genetic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") interventions offer an opportunity to adjust these rates and to examine, model, and ultimately regulate the process of aging in laboratory animals—and, potentially, in humans. However, identifying such interventions is currently both time consuming and cost prohibitive. An accurate estimator of the biological age of organisms subject to an intervention, as compared to their [chronological age](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/age "Learn more about chronological age from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), can resolve this problem and find many applications in biomedical science. Although no reliable molecular methods are currently available that could determine the biological age of model organisms, estimates of aging rates have recently been developed for humans based on DNA [methylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/methylation "Learn more about methylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (DNAm) profiles ([Hannum et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib17), [Horvath, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib18), [Weidner et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib36)).
DNAm has pivotal roles in regulation of transcriptional programs and systematically varies as a function of age ([Day et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib11), [Jones, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib25), [Jones et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib26), [Maegawa et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib27), [Schultz et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib30), [Smith and Meissner, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib31), [Zampieri et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib38)). These changes start during [embryogenesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/embryogenesis "Learn more about embryogenesis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and continue throughout the lifespan, affecting chromatin states, lineage specialization, gene expression, [genome stability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/genome-instability "Learn more about genome stability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and self-renewal of stem cells ([Beerman and Rossi, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib2), [Benayoun et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib3), [Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib29), [Guo et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib16), [Stelzer et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib32), [Sun et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib33), [Taiwo et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib34)). The human DNAm clock model can predict certain health outcomes, such as increased future mortality ([Chen et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib8), [Christiansen et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib9), [Horvath et al., 2015a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib21), [Marioni et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib28)). In addition, accelerated DNAm aging was observed in patients with HIV infection and Down syndrome, and slower DNAm changes were reported for cerebellum aging ([Horvath and Levine, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib19), [Horvath et al., 2015b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib22), [Horvath et al., 2015c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib23)). In this work, we sought to develop and employ a DNAm clock in the [house mouse](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mus-musculus "Learn more about house mouse from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (_Mus musculus_), the main [biological model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/biological-model "Learn more about biological model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of human aging and disease. The clock based on mouse blood DNA [methylome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/methylome "Learn more about methylome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") was prepared and applied to test longevity interventions.
## Results and Discussion
To assess global changes in the DNA [methylome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/methylome "Learn more about methylome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), we subjected whole blood DNA of 141 male C57BL/6 mice (16 age groups, ranging from 3- to 35-month-old animals) to a modified version of reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)A; [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#tbl1)). Among 3.9–13.0 million [CpG sites](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cpg-site "Learn more about CpG sites from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") detected in individual samples ([Tables S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc2) and [S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc3), related to [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#tbl1)), more than 1.9 million sites were present in all samples ([Figure S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)A, related to [Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)A and [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#tbl1)). These sites represented more than 8% of the mouse DNA methylome and mapped to 99% of UCSC RefGenes, 88% annotated [CpG islands](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cpg-island "Learn more about CpG islands from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), 55% CpG island shores, 41% promoters, and 10% predicted enhancers ([Figure S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)B). Overall, this RRBS procedure resulted in significant coverage of the mouse blood DNA methylome ([Figures S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)A–S1C; [Boyle et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib5)) and allowed us to assess its changes as a function of age.

To characterize the resulting DNA methylome, we extracted the leading age-dependent [DNAm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/methylation "Learn more about DNAm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") signature using non-negative matrix factorization and estimated the behavior of average [DNAm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/dna-methylation "Learn more about DNAm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with age. This revealed a global pattern of hypomethylation slowly developing with age, akin to that observed in humans ([Hannum et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib17), [Horvath, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib18)). Following development, the leading DNAm signature gradually decreased (, bisquare robust linear fit) with age changing by ∼5% ( two-sample t test) between 4 and 35 months of age ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)B). The weights of different CpG sites in the leading signature suggested that the pattern of hypomethylation is determined by the dynamics of [methylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/methylation "Learn more about methylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") levels on the whole DNA methylome.
To examine feasibility of the resulting partial DNA methylomes for describing the age of mice, we randomly divided 141 C57BL/6 mice into two subsets of 70 and 71 animals (subsets 1 and 2). DNAm clocks were then constructed separately for subsets 1 and 2 using elastic net regression with 10-fold cross-validation. The clock built using subset 1 was validated on the DNA methylation data from subset 2 ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)C) and vice versa ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)D); this revealed high correspondence between the methylation scores calculated using both subsets. Precision of the clocks built using subsets 1 or 2 and tested on subsets 2 or 1 generally decreased with age ([Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)A, related to [Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)C and 1D): in early life (<10 months) the [chronological age](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/age "Learn more about chronological age from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") corresponded to the DNA methylation age with precision of 1–3 months, whereas the precision dropped to 5–7 months for the oldest mice. However, the relative precision of the clock, defined as the ratio of the clock error to the chronological age, somewhat increased ([Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)B, related to [Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)C and 1D).
The subset 1 clock was determined by the weighted average methylation on 61 different CpG sites, and the subset 2 clock by the methylation on 77 CpG sites ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)E). Interestingly, 18 sites were common to both clocks ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)F), and the values of their contributing weights were close. A relatively small (but highly significant) overlap between the clocks built using Subsets 1 and 2 cannot be explained by a poor similarity of samples ([Figure S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)D, related to [Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)C and 1D). Instead, we suggest that this is due to the fact that DNA methylation levels of many CpG sites are correlated with each other, and elastic net regularization picks relatively small subsets of these correlated sites ([Figure S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)E, related to [Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)C and 1D). We also examined the previously built human DNA methylation clocks ([Hannum et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib17), [Horvath, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib18)) and observed several common CpG sites (three sites for the 89-site clock and two for the 71-site clock), even though these clocks were built using different tissues. The data thus show that mouse and likely other mammalian genomes are characterized by certain CpG sites that may represent the age of organisms.
To develop a more precise mouse DNA methylation clock, we constructed a class of elastic net regression clocks based on the whole dataset representing 141 C57BL/6 mice. Among the clocks corresponding to different values of regularization parameter, we chose the model (further designated as mDNAm clock) that minimized both cross-validation error and the chance of overfitting ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)A). We further recalculated the DNAm score into the methylation age, _Age_ _Met_ ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)B). On the training set, the estimated _Age_ _Met_ of C57BL/6 mice coincided with the chronological age of the samples () with the mean square difference between the mDNAm age and the chronological age of 16 days. To determine an out-of-sample lower-bound estimate on the precision of the clock, we again used subsets 1 and 2 ([Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)C and 1D). This estimation resulted in the lower out-of-sample bound on the precision of the clock  High accuracy of the model may be attributed to the use of a single mouse strain and identical environmental conditions, although these factors may also introduce a source of bias. There is also a potential for confounding as a result of changes of [blood cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/hemocyte "Learn more about blood cell from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") composition as a function of age ([Marioni et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib28)).

Figure 2. Development of the mDNAm Clock
(A) Selection of the optimally robust mDNAm clock. The clock corresponding to the minimum cross-validation deviation error is a weighted average of the DNAm levels of 109 CpG sites. The optimally robust clock is a weighted average of the DNAm levels of 90 CpG sites.
(B) Estimation of the mDNAm age of C57BL/6 control males.
(C) Trajectories of methylation levels of the 90 CpG sites that form the clock. Age-related increases in DNAm are shown in red, and decreases are shown in blue. Solid dark blue and red lines correspond to the signal averaged over the CpG sites, with methylation levels decreasing or increasing with age, respectively.
(D) The overlap between the CpG sites contributing to the 90-site mDNAm clock (red circle), subset 1 clock (lower left), and subset 2 clock (lower right). Gene list on the right shows genes that include 17 CpG sites common to all clocks.
(E) Distribution and weights of 90 CpG sites defining the clock along the genome. Positions of the contributing CpG sites within the genome are shown. CpGs were located within the bodies of particular genes, introns, and [untranslated regions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/untranslated-region "Learn more about untranslated regions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as well as in intergentic regions. Most mouse chromosomes (except 3, 17, X, and Y) contain at least one CpG site contributing to the clock. The color scheme shows the indicated sequence or functional elements within which the sites reside.
The mDNAm clock was defined by a weighted average DNA methylation over 90 CpG sites ([Figures 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)C and [S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)F, related to [Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)C). The methylation state of these sites changed gradually, decelerating with age, with both hypomethylated and hypermethylated sites approaching more intermediate DNA methylation values ([Figures 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)C and [S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)F). The sites contributed unequally to the mDNAm clock ([Table S3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc4), related to [Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)C) and formed several distinct clusters (∼30) associated with genes _Hsf4_ , _Kcns2_ , _Map10_ , _Tns2_ , _Wnt3a_ , and _Zscan2_. We found that 17 out of 18 CpG sites common to subset 1 and 2 clocks were also present among 90 CpG sites of the mDNAm clock ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)D). Most of these 17 CpG sites were located within introns of _Ciita_ , _Cd200r4_ , _Rasgef1c_ , _Wnt3a_ , and _Zscan2_ , and several were clustered. CpG sites in introns of particular genes often play a role of their secondary enhancers ([Blattler et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib4)), and we note that several identified genes are involved in development, differentiation, and tissue [morphogenesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/morphogenesis "Learn more about morphogenesis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), consistent with a program-like behavior ([Gladyshev, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib14)). The CpG sites contributing to the mDNAm clock were distributed across the chromosomes ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)E) and did not match the sites observed in human clocks ([Hannum et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib17), [Horvath, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib18)). In addition, the pace of human and mouse clocks differed considerably, reflecting the difference in the rates of aging in humans and mice.
We further tested whether the mDNAm clock can detect the effects of interventions that are known to increase lifespan and delay age-dependent phenotypic changes and thus plausibly serve as an index of the biological age of mice rather than their chronological age. Estimation of _Age_ _met_ for calorie-restricted C57BL/6 males (four age groups, with dietary intervention started at 14 weeks for all mice; [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#tbl1)) revealed on average 20% lower _Age_ _Met_ than their chronological age ([Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)A), consistent with the effect of [calorie](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/calorie "Learn more about calorie from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") restriction on lifespan in this strain ([Turturro et al., 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib35)). The lower biological age of calorie-restricted mice was highly significant in the tested age groups ([Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)A; one-sided, two-sample t test for in the combined age groups, ); however, the effect was less pronounced in younger animals (10-month-old mice) and was not observed in a separate experiment where 4-month-old mice were subjected to calorie restriction for 2 months ([Figure S3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)A, related to [Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)A; for the t test of the control and calorie-restricted group DNA methylation ages belonging to different distributions). This observation is congruent with the finding that severe weight loss in humans following bariatric surgery was not accompanied by a reduction of DNAm age ([Horvath et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib20)). Thus, the pattern of DNA methylation indicative of the difference between biological and chronological age appears to develop gradually, suggesting a cumulative function.

Figure 3. Applications of the mDNAm Clock
(A) Application of the mDNAm clock (light blue) to calorie-restricted (CR) C57BL/6 males (red). Light blue blobs not connected to the clock correspond to 20- and 35-day-old samples, with each cohort including six mice (not used to construct the clock).
(B) Whole-body growth-hormone-receptor knockout (GHR-KO) and WT ([C57BL/6J x BALB/cByJ]/F2) mice. The chronological age of GHR-KO mice was months, and the chronological age of WT mice was months.

(D) Comparing mDNAm ages of B6D2F1 and C57BL/6 mice. The differences between chronological and mDNAm ages were calculated for cohorts of B6D2F1 and C57BL/6 mice.
(E) Comparing mDNAm ages of B6D2F1 control (AL) strain and the same calorie-restricted (CR) strain. The differences between chronological and mDNAm ages were calculated for AL and CR cohorts.
(F) Mouse lung and kidney fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived iPSCs. Fibroblasts were collected from C57BL/6 mice and grown in culture; iPSCs were then generated from them. Blue and green marks on the right of the bars represent individual samples.
We also examined [genetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/genetics "Learn more about genetic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") interventions of longevity. Full-body [growth hormone receptor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/growth-hormone-receptor "Learn more about growth hormone receptor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") knockout (GHR-KO) ([Coschigano et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib10)) showed a robust reduction in _Age_ _Met_ as compared to control (one-sided, two-sample t test, ; [Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)B). Application of the mDNAm clock to [Snell dwarf mice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/snell-dwarf-mouse "Learn more about Snell dwarf mice from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and their respective wild-type control ([DW/J × C3H/HEJ]/F2) showed, on average, 50% lower age (one-sided, two-sample t test, ) of Snell dwarf mice ([Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)C), consistent with 42% mean survival extension in this longevity model ([Flurkey et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib12)). Although the clock was developed using samples of male mice, we found that it also correctly predicted the age of female mice ([Figures S3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)B–S3E, related to [Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)).
We further analyzed additional genetic backgrounds. The difference between _Age_ _Met_ of [B6D2F1 mice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/b6d2f1-mouse "Learn more about B6D2F1 mice from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and their chronological age was not statistically significant (one-sided, two-sample t test, ; [Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)D). The _Age_ _Met_ of calorie-restricted B6D2F1 mice was 20% lower than that of the corresponding ad libitum mice (one-sided, two-sample t test, ; [Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)E). We also analyzed the _Age_ _Met_ of 20- and 35-day-old C57BL/6 mice, which were the ages not covered by the clock, and the model correctly estimated the age of these mice ([Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)A).
Finally, we collected kidney and lung fibroblasts from 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice, maintained and aged them in culture, and prepared six independent [iPSC](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/induced-pluripotent-stem-cell "Learn more about iPSC from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") lines from them ([Figure S4,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1) related to [STAR Methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#sec3) sections “[Primary Fibroblasts and Generation of Mouse iPSCs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#sec3.3.4)” and “[Characterization of Mouse iPSCs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#sec3.3.5)”). The calculated _Age_ _Met_ of kidney and lung fibroblasts was days and days, respectively, whereas all iPSCs were less than 1 month old (kidney, days; lung, days; [Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)F). Although estimation of the exact age of fibroblasts and iPSCs may be influenced by the fact that the clock was developed based on mouse blood, the data show that the iPSC procedure modifies mDNAm to resemble that seen in younger blood. A similar effect was previously observed in human studies ([Horvath, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib18)).
We think that identification of a relatively small set of CpG sites forming the clock is possible because of a very large number of observables (CpG sites) produced by the RRBS procedure and then subjected to elastic net regression, which extracts a combination of sites responsible for a given age-dependent pattern of behavior. Thus, presumably, accurate [molecular clocks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/molecular-clock "Learn more about molecular clocks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") measuring biological age of a sample may also be developed based on other high-throughput approaches, such as metabolite profiling and RNA-seq. The structure of the mDNAm clock may also change when the clock is developed across mouse tissues, as was previously observed for the DNA methylation clocks in humans ([Hannum et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib17), [Horvath, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib18)). We also suggest that researchers utilizing the clock use experimental and control groups to determine the difference between chronological and biological age, as the RRBS procedure is not fully standardized. For example, a discrepancy of ∼2 months between the chronological and estimated biological age of the GHR-KO and Snell controls ([Figures 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)B and 3C) can, in principle, be attributed to a lower precision on the methylation clock out of sample and/or a difference in genetic background. It should be expected that whole-genome bisulfate sequencing data may further add to the power and resolution of the DNA methylation clocks due to a further increase in the number of age-dependent observables.
To conclude, we constructed a robust epigenetic clock based on the age-dependent behavior of blood DNA methylomes of C57BL/6 mice. The clock can estimate the age of cohorts of C57BL/6 mice, characterize the change in biological age in other mouse models, and evaluate the effects of genetic, pharmacological, and dietary interventions on average lifespan. More broadly, we found that there are certain CpG sites in mammals that are scattered across the genome, differ across species, and can form the biological clock. These sites can differentiate chronological and biological ages of organisms in a cumulative manner and represent a biomarker of aging. It may be expected that a related set of CpG sites may form a multitissue clock similar to that observed in humans ([Horvath, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib18)). We suggest that the mDNAm clock will find many applications in biomedical science, especially in areas where mouse models may be associated with changes in healthspan and lifespan.

### Method details
#### Mouse Models
All mice used in this study, with the exception of Snell dwarf, GHR-KO models and 3-5-week-old C57BL/6 mice, were obtained from the NIA Aged Rodent Colony ([Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#tbl1)). The oldest mice obtained from NIA were 32 months; to obtain mice 34 and 35 months of age, 32-month old mice were aged at Brigham & Women’s Hospital (BWH) for 2 and 3 months, respectively. Three of the six 35-month-old samples were from a different facility and denoted with an “R” ([Table S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc2), related to [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#tbl1)). With the exception of mice at the 34 and 35 month time points, blood from all mice used for the clock was collected within 2 weeks of arrival from NIA. Snell dwarf and GHR-KO models and their controls were housed at the University of Michigan. The 3-5-week-old C57BL/6 mice were bred at BWH, Harvard Medical School, from parents obtained from NIA. [Calorie](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/calorie "Learn more about Calorie from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") restriction started at 14 weeks of age and continued until the time when the animals were sacrificed. For all other animals, food was provided ad libitum. Blood was isolated from the inferior vena cavae, with the exception of 3-5-week-old mice and Snell dwarf and GHR-KO mice (and their corresponding controls), in which blood was isolated directly from heart. The blood was immediately mixed with EDTA, and 100 μl was placed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (Zymo). In the case of Snell dwarf and GHR-KO mice, including the corresponding controls, 100 μl EDTA mixed blood was placed in 100 μl of DNA/RNA Shield (2X concentrate) (Zymo).
#### Genomic DNA Purification
DNA from samples in lysis buffer was purified by using Quick-gDNA Blood MiniPrep kit (Zymo) using manufacturer’s instructions. DNA from samples in DNA/RNA 2X concentrate was purified by using Quick-DNA Universal kit (Zymo). DNA was eluted from columns in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Then, 2 μl of [RNase A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ribonuclease-a "Learn more about RNase A from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Life Technologies) was added to each sample. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 min, and DNA was prepared by using Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator-10 (Zymo). DNA was eluted in 25 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and quantified using a Qubit 2.0 (Life Technologies).
#### RRBS
Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was performed as previously reported with few modifications ([Boyle et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib5), [Gu et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib15)). MspI digestions were set up by adding 100 ng of DNA sample to 1 μl of MspI (20 U/μl) (New England Biolabs), 3 μl of 10x NEB buffer 2 (New England Biolabs), and nuclease-free water to obtain a reaction volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 17 hr. Then, 1 μl of Klenow fragment (3′-5′ exo-) (New England Biolabs) and 1 μl of dNTP mixture containing 10 mM dATP, 1 mM dCTP, and 1 mM dGTP were added to each sample for DNA end repair and A-tailing. The reactions were performed in a thermocycler without a heated lid. The program was set to 30°C for 20 min, 37°C for 20 min and 65°C for 20 min. Subsequently, ligation reactions were set up by adding 4.8 μl of T4 Ligation buffer, 1.6 μl of T4 [DNA Ligase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/dna-ligase "Learn more about DNA Ligase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (New England Biolabs), and 3.2 of μl [TruSeq](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/illumina-dye-sequencing "Learn more about TruSeq from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") Nano DNA LT adaptor from Illumina that was diluted 1:20, and 6.4 μl of nuclease-free water to the DNA samples. We used 6-7 different indexed adaptors per library. The reactions were incubated at 16°C for 16 hr.
After ligation, 1.2x SPRI bead clean-up was performed on the samples by adding 52 μl of water and 120 μl of Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). The mixture was pipetted 10 times and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged and placed in 96-side magnet for 10 min. All liquid was removed without disturbing the bead pellets. Three washes were performed by adding 200 μl 80% ethanol to each sample still in the magnet, letting the samples sit at room temperature for 30 s, and removing ethanol without disturbing the beads. After the final wash, beads were dried at room temperature for 15-20 min. The samples were removed from the magnet and 40 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer was added to elute the DNA. Beads were then resuspended and samples were placed on the magnet for 10 min incubation at room temperature. Finally, the supernatant containing the eluted DNA was removed from the beads without disturbing them.
The purified DNA was quantified by [qPCR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/real-time-polymerase-chain-reaction "Learn more about qPCR from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") using the Kapa Complete Universal Kit (KAPA Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were pooled in libraries of 6 to 7. Subsequently, the libraries underwent [bisulfite](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/bisulfite "Learn more about bisulfite from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo) and eluted in 40 μl of buffer provided by the kit.
The bisulfite-converted samples were amplified by setting up 200 μl reactions consisting of 30 μl of library sample, 4 μl of Pfu Turbo Cx Hotstart [DNA Polymerase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/dna-polymerase "Learn more about DNA Polymerase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), 2.5 U/μl (Agilent), 20 μl of 10X buffer (Agilent), 2 μl of dNTP mix (25 mM each, 100 mM total), 32 μl of Illumina TruSeq primer mix (2.5 μM each, 5.0 μM total), and 112 μl of nuclease-free water. The 200 μl reactions were then divided into aliquots of 50 μl and ran on a thermocycler as follows: Step 1: 95°C for 2 min; Step 2: for the least amount of cycles required for final amplification at 95°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s; Step 3: 72° for 7 min; Step 4: hold at 4°C. To determine the least amount of cycles needed, 10 μl test reactions (1 μl of library sample, 0.2 μl of Pfu Turbo Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase, 2.5 U/μl (Agilent), 1 μl of 10X buffer (Agilent), 0.1 μl of dNTP mix (25 mM each, 100 mM total), 1.6 μl of Illumina TruSeq primer mix (2.5 μM each, 5.0 μM total), and 6.1 of μl nuclease-free water) were performed using 9, 11, and 13 cycles. After the final PCR amplification, each individual sample was pooled into a 1.5 mL tube. A 1.2x SPRI bead clean-up was performed on the samples by adding 240 μl of Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The mixture was pipetted 10 times and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Then, the samples were centrifuged and placed on a magnetic rack for 10 min. All liquid was removed without disturbing the bead pellets. Two washes were performed by adding 1 mL of 80% ethanol still in the magnet, letting the sample sit at room temperature for 30 s, and removing ethanol from the sample without disturbing the beads. After the final wash, beads were dried at room temperature for 15-20 min. The samples were removed from the magnet and 40 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer was added to each sample to elute the DNA. Beads were re-suspended and samples were placed on the magnet for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the supernatant containing the eluted DNA was removed from the beads without disturbing them. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using 75 paired-end sequencing with v4 reagents. Since [RRBS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing "Learn more about RRBS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") libraries generate low complexity libraries, the samples were spiked with ∼10% phiX.
Equipment required for the construction of RRBS libraries included a qPCR machine, thermal cycler, NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Qubit fluorimeter with associated reagents, a DynaMag-2 magnet (Life Technologies), Bioanalyzer with associated reagents or TapeStation with High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies), and a DyanMag 96-side magnet (Life Technologies).
#### Primary Fibroblasts and Generation of Mouse iPSCs
Primary fibroblasts were prepared from lungs and kidneys of 10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% nonessential [amino acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/amino-acid "Learn more about amino acids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics. [Lentiviral vectors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lentivirus-vector "Learn more about Lentiviral vectors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") 4F2A and M2rtTA (Addgene plasmids #20321 and #20342) were used to reprogram fibroblasts ([Carey et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib7)). 48 hr after transfection of HEK293T cells, supernatants containing viral particles were harvested, filtered, and directly used for transduction of fibroblasts. Infected fibroblasts were seeded onto a [feeder layer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/feeder-cell "Learn more about feeder layer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in ESC medium in the presence of 2 mg/ml doxycycline (DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 × 106 units [leukemia inhibitory factor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/leukemia-inhibitory-factor "Learn more about leukemia inhibitory factor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% nonessential [amino acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/amino-acids "Learn more about amino acids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics ([Buganim et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib6)). On day 10, [iPSC](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/induced-pluripotent-stem-cell "Learn more about iPSC from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") colonies were picked, dissociated by trypsin digestion, and plated into new culture dishes. These iPSCs were subcultured every 2–3 days. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Testing for [mycoplasma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mycoplasma "Learn more about mycoplasma from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") was routinely performed.
#### Characterization of Mouse iPSCs
Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using the [Alkaline Phosphatase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/alkaline-phosphatase "Learn more about Alkaline Phosphatase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") Staining Kit (Stemgent) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For fluorescence [immunocytochemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/immunocytochemistry "Learn more about immunocytochemistry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), iPSCs were cultured on mitotically inactivated MEFs for 2–3 days and fixed using PBS containing 4% PFA (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, fixed cells were blocked and permeabilised for 1 hr in PBS containing 10% (v/v) goat serum (Sigma) in 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS. Primary antibodies were as follows: OCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotech), [SOX2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/sox2 "Learn more about SOX2 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Millipore), NANOG (Millipore), and SSEA-1 (Santa Cruz Biotech), which were diluted 1:100 in blocking solution. Fixed cells were incubated with the primary antibody solution overnight at 4°C. After washing out the primary antibody solution, fixed cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (labeled with Alexa 488, 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained using 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies). All fluorescence imaging was conducted using an LSM 700 [confocal microscope](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/confocal-microscopy "Learn more about confocal microscope from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Zeiss).
#### Generation of Embryoid Bodies and Analysis
Colonies growing on MEFs were detached using 0.05% trypsin and grown as a [suspension culture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/suspension-cell-culture "Learn more about suspension culture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on low adherent plates using ESC medium without LIF. After 1 week of suspension growth, cells were transferred to 12- or 24-well plates coated with 0.1% gelatin and grown in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. Embryoid bodies were grown for 1–2 weeks prior to fixation and immunofluorescence staining. Cultures were fixed and stained as described above using the following antibodies: AFP (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotech), [GATA4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/gata4 "Learn more about GATA4 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotech), α-actinin (1:200, Sigma), GFAP (1:500, Dako), and TUJ-1(1:500, Covance).
### Quantification and Statistical Analysis
#### Analysis of Sequence Reads
Mouse genome assembly GRCm38.p2 and its annotation were downloaded from NCBI (). Locations of [CpG islands](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cpg-island "Learn more about CpG islands from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for mm10 (Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Build 38) were obtained from UCSC (, released on 07-Mar-2012). CpG island shores were defined as regions 2 kp upstream and downstream of islands. Ensemble annotated features (release 82, ) were utilized for the purpose of identification of promoters. Location of enhancers was based on a list of previously predicted enhancers ([Yue et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib37)). The quality of high throughput sequence libraries was verified using “FastQC v.0.10.1” package (). Adaptor removal and quality trimming were performed using Trim Galore! v.0.4.0. The TrimGalore tool () was used with settings optimized for RRBS. Methylation sites were detected using Bismark v.0.14.5 according to the program’s manual. During postprocessing, the identified [methylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/methylation "Learn more about methylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") sites present in samples were extracted using R procedures and custom Perl scripts and used for further analyses.
#### Estimating the Leading Methylation Signature and Its Age-Dependent Pattern
The leading methylation signature was estimated by performing the dimensionality reduction ([Antoulas and Sorensen, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib1)) of the whole blood partial DNA methylomes of 141 C57BL/6 mice as follows:
All DNA methylomes/samples were combined into a single dataset , where is the number of samples and  is the number of [CpG sites](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cpg-site "Learn more about CpG sites from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), covered in each single observation ( 1.9M), keeping the rows of the matrix chronologically ordered, thee non-negative matrix factorization of the dataset was performed:(1)(Applying non-negative matrix factorization to DNA methylomes as observables of interest (methylation levels) are always manifestly non-negative, and the methylation signatures should encode this.)
The dimensionality reduction of the dataset was performed, the result of the procedure approximating by a rank 1 matrix(2)(The “low-rank” approximation above is valid in the sense of ratio of the Frobenius norms of the matrices and being of the order 1. Namely, for the dataset of 141 DNA methylomes of C57BL/6 mice it was found that where denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrix .)
The age-dependent methylation signature was defined as(3)
The weights, which different CpG sites contribute to the leading age-dependent signature, were defined according to the prescription(4)
We found a very large number of sites contributing to the leading age-dependent signature represented in [Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)B. While no sites had weights larger than , ∼194,000 CpG sites had weights larger than , ∼450,000 CpG sites weights larger than , and ∼570,000 CpG sites weights larger than , confirming that the age-related hypomethylation pattern is a characteristics of the mouse DNA methylome as a whole. The non-negative matrix factorization was performed in [MATLAB](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/sequest "Learn more about MATLAB from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") using nnmf command.
To avoid possible confusion, it has to be noted that the procedure described here is different from the [principal component analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/principal-component-analysis "Learn more about principal component analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (PCA) in an important respect: the first leading NNMF component of the data does not encode the variance of the data and instead roughly corresponds to the mean of the data. The mean of the data was not subtracted before performing non-negative matrix factorization of the data; the latter was performed to check whether a good low-rank approximation of the data matrix is possible and to find such an approximation.
#### Controlling for Batch Effect
In order to minimize the possible batch effect on the behavior of age-dependent methylation signatures, all samples used to construct the mDNAm clock (144 C57BL/6 males) were divided into 5 groups (sequenced by individual flow cells; [Table S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc3), related to [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#tbl1)), with each group including samples from mice of different ages - from 3 to 35 months. Each flow cell had 8 sequencing lanes (columns in [Table S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc3)), and all sequencing lanes in any of the flow cells had samples representing different age groups. Other considered confounding variables were the adaptor numbers and library numbers ([Table S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc3)). The values of other confounding variables (such as a researcher preparing samples) were the same for all samples used to build the clock and could not contribute to a possible batch effect. The adaptor numbers were uncorrelated with the age group (correlation coefficient , ) and accounting for the corresponding confounding variable did not contribute to the clock structure. By construction, library numbers had a high correlation with the flow cell number (correlation coefficient ) and thus together were reduced to a single independent confounding variable. Although samples of different ages were randomized, there was ∼30% redundant anticorrelation between the age-group and the flow cell number, so the possibility of the batch effect due to this correlation was studied further, and its significance was estimated as follows.
First, the PCA analysis of the data matrix Xij was performed. It was found that the leading PCA component (PCA1) explains about 6% of the total variance in the data, the second one (PCA2) contributes slightly more than 5% to the total variance, the 3rd - about 3%, etc. ([Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)C, related to [Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)B). The contribution of the first PCA component was then subtracted from the data, and the age-dependent behavior of the MSctotal score constructed using the remaining part of the data was found to be unchanged ([Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)D, related to [Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)B).
Second, the batch effect analysis analogous to the one described in ([Johnson et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib24)) was performed. Namely, the linear model establishing the correlation between DNA methylation data, the batch (flow cell) number and the age was constructed, assuming both additive batch contribution and the dependence of the error variance on the batch number. Again, it was found that the batch effect in the obtained data is negligible ([Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)E; related to [Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1)B).
Finally, a linear mixed-effects model (Age=β⋅M+Z⋅b+ϵ, where ϵ is the observation error vector) was constructed with methylation data as the fixed-effects variables M and flow cell numbers, adaptor numbers and library numbers as random-effects (confounding) variables Z. The vector of weights β was then compared with a similar vector βbare constructed using a liner model Age=βbare⋅M+ϵ not taking into account the effect of confounding variables. It was found that the vectors β and βbare correlated perfectly with each other (correlation coefficient 0.999, ∼10−97; [Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#mmc1)F).
#### Constructing the Elastic Net Regression Clock and Estimating the Methylation Age of Samples
The elastic net regression clock describing a systematic age-dependent change in whole blood partial DNA methylomes of C57BL/6 males was defined as a vector w of weights of CpG sites contributing to the clock. The clock DNAm score at the chronological age of the sample t was then given by(5)MSc(Age)=w1⋅M1(Age)+w2⋅M2(Age)+…,where Mi(Age) is the DNAm level on a CpG site i contributing to the clock, estimated at the chronological age Age.
The vector w characterizing the clock was constructed as follows.
1. The m=141 DNA methylome samples were combined into a single N×M matrix X, where the index M corresponds to the total number (≈1.9M) of CpG sites of the overlap between different samples.
2. Numerical minimization of the target functionT=||w0+w⋅MT−Age||+λ2(12(w⋅w)+||w||1)==12N∑i=1N(w⋅Mi+w0−Age)2+12∑j=1n(12wj2+|wj|),(where N is the number of observations and n is the number of predictors) with different values of the Tikhonov regularization parameter λ was then performed with 20-fold cross-validation of the identified minimum. As usual, an k-fold cross-validation represented a random separation of the original dataset into k subsets, with k−1 subsets used to train the clock and the remaining subset to validate it; the procedure was then repeated k times, the results of elastic net regression were averaged out over k repeats, and the deviation error D (cross-validation deviance) was estimated ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)A).
3. The cross-validation deviance (as well as the mean square error in its estimation) was evaluated for every scanned value of λ, and the value of λ=λmin(D) corresponding to the minimum of cross-validation deviance was identified ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)A).
4. To minimize the possibility of overfitting without much loss of predictability the value of λ=λ1σ=33.1269 corresponding to a 1σ deviation from λ=λmin(D) was chosen. The age estimation by the clock was performed as follows. Behavior of the DNAm score on the chronological age was approximated (R2=0.9958) by the power law(6)MSc=a⋅Ageb+c,where a=0.1666±0.1024, b=0.4185±0.0767 and c=−1.712±0.3010. The constants a,b,c were found by performing the mean square regression of the DNAm scores of the actual samples calculated using the Equation (5) to the power law (6) (a nonlinear least-squares fit was performed using trust-region-reflective algorithm employed in MATLAB).
The _Age_ _Met_ of the samples was then calculated by inverting the functional dependence (6) as(7)Agemet=(MSc−ca)1/b±(MSc−ca)1b−11bΔ(MSc),where Δ(MSc) is the estimation error for the DNA methylation score.
It was found that the methylation clock corresponding to the minimum deviance is determined by methylation levels on 108 CpG sites ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)A), while the more robust (subject to lesser overfitting) clock corresponding to the choice λ=λ1σ is determined by methylation levels on 90 CpG sites homogeneously distributed across the genome ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2)E). The elastic regression clock was constructed in MATLAB using the command lassoglm (MethylationLevels, ChronologicalAge, ‘poisson’, ‘CV’, 20, ‘Alpha’, 0.5), where the third argument implied a [Poisson distribution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/poisson-distribution "Learn more about Poisson distribution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of nonsystematic variation of responses, the fourth argument - 20-fold cross-validation and the 6th argument enforced the form of the target function described above. The choice of α, which we used, corresponds to the equal weights of lasso (pure L1) and ridge (pure L2) optimizations. The lassoglm command uses the coordinate descent algorithm ([Friedman et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#bib13)); in our case, the default value 10−4 for the convergence threshold was used.
#### Statistical Analysis of Data Represented on [Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig1), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig2), and [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117301687?via%3Dihub#fig3)
Application of standard t tests for estimation of the effects of longevity interventions on the methylation age was validated by the distributions of methylation levels on individual CpG sites, which exhibited a distinct quasi-Gaussian peak. As the mDNAm clock is defined as a linear combination of methylation levels on n≫1 sites, the stochastic variable defining the value of mDNAm age, subject to the central limit theorem, is normally distributed with nonzero mean.

Show abstract
In recent years, stem cell therapy has become a very promising and advanced scientific research topic. The development of treatment methods has evoked great expectations. This paper is a review focused on the discovery of different stem cells and the potential therapies based on these cells. The genesis of stem cells is followed by laboratory steps of controlled stem cell culturing and derivation. Quality control and teratoma formation assays are important procedures in assessing the properties of the stem cells tested. Derivation methods and the utilization of culturing media are crucial to set proper environmental conditions for controlled differentiation. Among many types of stem tissue applications, the use of graphene scaffolds and the potential of extracellular vesicle-based therapies require attention due to their versatility. The review is summarized by challenges that stem cell therapy must overcome to be accepted worldwide. A wide variety of possibilities makes this cutting edge therapy a turning point in modern medicine, providing hope for untreatable diseases.
