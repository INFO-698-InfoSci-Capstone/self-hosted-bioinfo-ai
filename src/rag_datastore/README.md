# RAG Datastore

This repository contains the structure for the RAG datastore project.
It includes directories for:
- **Raw data** (PDFs, code, knowledge bases)
- **Processed data** (preprocessed and chunked documents)
- **Embeddings** (stored vector representations)
- **Vector DB** (e.g., ChromaDB storage)
- **Scripts** (data processing and ingestion scripts)
- **App** (RAG-based query API)

Follow the instructions in the scripts and README to curate and import your data.
