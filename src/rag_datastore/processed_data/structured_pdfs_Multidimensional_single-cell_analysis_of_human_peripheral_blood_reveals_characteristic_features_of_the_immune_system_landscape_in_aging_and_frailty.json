            "content": "Human aging is an unavoidable, progressive, whole-organism process, with a substantial contribution from the deteriorating immune system. Molecular evidence of a general age-dependent deterioration of the human immune system, along with the mechanisms responsible for why some older adults maintain high immune performance while many others are fragile, remains elusive. Transcriptome studies have revealed aging-related gene expression alteration in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and other immune cell populations. However, most of these studies were based on chronological aging, not the organismal aspects of biological aging, such as frailty.\n\nFrailty is an intermediate status between healthy aging and death, defined as a combination of reduced strength, decreased physiological reserve and increased biological vulnerability and physiological malfunctioning. Deterioration of the immune system is a key hallmark of frailty and plays an important role in etiology and pathogenesis of frailty. Several high-throughput omics studies have suggested that immune senescence was involved in frailty from the levels of genetics, transcription, protein and metabolism, and most of those changes were also reported in healthy aging processes. In addition, the bulk-cell-based omics studies have masked the variation of cell subpopulation proportions. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study of immune cells ranging from newborn to healthy aging and frailty at the single-cell level. Accordingly, we aimed to dissect the characteristics of immune cells across the spectrum of aging using cord blood from neonates, and peripheral blood from healthy young adults and from non-frail and frail old individuals, and to analyze these samples with both transcriptomics and T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire changes at the single-cell level.",

            "content": "Age-group definition and frailty assessment. To investigate the transcriptome and TCR landscape of aging human immune cells, we collected mononuclear cells from umbilical cord blood (n\u2009=\u20093) and PBMCs of young (n\u2009=\u20093; age, 30.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.0 years), healthy old (n\u2009=\u20096; age, 85.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 years) and frail (n\u2009=\u20095; age, 88.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 years) individuals, and performed paralleled single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) and surface protein antibody-barcode sequencing (CCR7, CD45RA, CD4+ and CD8+; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Methods). From here on, we refer to these four groups as cord blood, young, old and frail.\n\nFrailty Index scores of the adult donors aged \u226565 years were clinically assessed (Methods and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). These individuals were classified into an old group (non-frail) and a frail group according to the corresponding Frailty Index, rather than chronological age (Fig. 1a). The old group had considerably lower Frailty Index scores in comparison to the frail group (0.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 versus 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16; lower is better), mostly reflected by having less cognitive disorders (cognitive disorder index, 0.095\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13 versus 0.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15; lower is better) and better mobility capability (disability score, 1.33\u2009\u00b1\u20091.63 versus 11.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.14; lower is better; Supplementary Table 1). The old group suffered from less chronical diseases than the frail group (1.83\u2009\u00b1\u20091.47 versus 4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.58). Lastly, three of the five frail donors had depression, while all of the old donors did not.\n\nComparison of major immune cells across age groups. In total, we produced high-quality scRNA-seq data from 114,467 mononuclear cells (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1c,d and Methods). Clustering analysis classified cells into 17 clusters (Fig. 1b and Methods). Based on the marker genes (Supplementary Table 3), expression of cell surface proteins and detection of productive TCRs, we annotated the identity of each cluster, and the proportions of each cell type were determined (Fig. 1b,c, Extended Data Fig. 1e\u2013g and Supplementary Table 4). According to the expression of fetus-specific genes, the cord blood samples were of high purity from fetal-derived cells (Extended Data Fig. 1h).\nClusters 1, 2 and 3 were distinguishable as na\u00efve, memory CD4+ and memory CD8+ T cells, respectively, based on the cell surface protein detection (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Cluster 6 and 9 with mixed expression of CD4+ and CD8+ were named as \u2018other T cells\u2019 and further analyzed later. Clusters 7 and 16 (CD79A, CD74 and MS4A1 high) were identified as B cells and antigen presenting B (APC B) cells, respectively, as cells in cluster 16 had specific expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens (Supplementary Table 3). Clusters 5, 8 and 14 (NKG7, GNLY, KLRB1 and GZMB high) were identified as natural killer (NK) cells. The myeloid lineage cells (clusters 4, 10 and 12) were classified as classical, intermediate and nonclassical monocytes, respectively, attributing to varying levels of S100A9, LYZ, IL1B and FCGR3A expression. Lastly, small amounts of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs; cluster 11), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs; cluster 15), platelets (cluster 13) and granulocytes (cluster 17) were identified (Fig. 1c).\nThe variation of each major cell population size through aging was largely consistent with that found in a previous study (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Cord blood samples comprised very few memory T cells (clusters 2 and 3) and \u2018other T cells\u2019 (clusters 6 and 9; Fig. 1d), potentially implying that cells in clusters 6 and 9 were in a more activated state or developed T-cell properties specific to adults. The fraction of \u2018other T cells\u2019 gradually rose as the chronological age of samples increased (Fig. 1e). In contrast, the population of na\u00efve T cells continuously shrunk as age increased. The amount of na\u00efve T cells dropped steeply from young to old groups. B-cell clusters remained relatively constant, while the NK 1 cell population slightly dropped in the young group comparing to the cord blood group, but then gradually expanded to larger sizes in old and frail groups (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1j). Monocyte populations for cord blood, old and frail groups were of similar sizes, whereas the young group contained the fewest monocytes, in line with an earlier study.\n\nT-cell subtype dynamics through aging. T cells accounted for 59.0% of cells captured in this study. To achieve a more refined T-cell subtype classification, we extracted clusters 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 (Fig. 1b) for a second round of clustering analysis (Methods). The results yielded six T-cell clusters (Fig. 1f). Based on the specifically expressed marker genes (Supplementary Table 3) and cell surface protein (CCR7, CD45RA, CD4 and CD8) expression levels, these six clusters were annotated as na\u00efve T, CD4+ central memory T (TCM), CD8+ TCM, CD8+ effector memory T (TEM), regulatory T (Treg) and exhausted T (GZMB and GZMK low; IL10RA high) cells, respectively (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013c).\n\nAs age increased, the composition of T cells shifted toward more-developed memory T cells (Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Table 4). Cord blood T cells were predominantly (90.0%) na\u00efve T cells. Relative to the total amount of T cells, the proportion of na\u00efve T cells sharply declined through the cord blood to the old group, then remained at around 25% (Fig. 1i). Among the three adult groups, the frail group had more CD4+ TCM cells, while the old group had more CD8+ TCM and Treg cells. This potentially implies that the balance between CD8+ and CD4+ TCM cells plays an important role in maintaining the immune system vitality in aged individuals. The three adult groups comprised similar amounts of CD8+ TEM cells. Exhausted T cells with high expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) NEAT1 and MALAT1 were mostly identified in the aged donors (Fig. 1h,i), potentially implying that NEAT1 and MALAT1 are markers of lymphocyte aging. Overall, as the chronological age increases, T cells differentiate into functional and more-developed memory states, and eventually become exhausted. In addition, T-cell exhaustion seemed independent of the physiological condition of the aged donors.\n\nTCR repertoire landscape and dynamics through aging. The scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data from the same samples link cell type and TCR information for the same cell. Using the cell type defined by the scRNA-seq data, over 50% of T cells (clusters 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 of Fig. 1b) were identified with paired TCR \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains, whereas the detection rate for non-T cells was only ~2%, indicating high specificity of scTCR-seq and validity of T-cell definition",

            "content": "Our study provided an atlas of transcriptome and TCR clonotypes on the single-cell level in human immune cells from newborn to frailty. Compared to other aging studies with omics7,33\u201335, the analyzed participants in this study covered newborn, young adults, healthy and frail old individuals. Previous studies based on chronological age had brought controversial results7, partially because of individual variation in aging progression. The use of a functional classification of human aging, such as healthy aging versus frailty, might be a better categorical way to narrow down the variation, and distinguish the phenotypes and mechanisms between healthy and unhealthy aging. In addition, scRNA-seq, scTCR-seq and cell surface protein antibody-barcoded sequencing in parallel is a powerful tool for immune profiling.\n\nThe major features of human immune aging described earlier10,33,34, such as decreased na\u00efve lymphocytes and TCR repertoire, and increased effector and memory cells with high inflammation response, are supported, but our analysis with high-resolution data dug up more details and expanded the human immune aging characterizations. One study recently showed the different characteristics of aged immune profiles between male and females34. In our study, the autosomal gender-specific genes had rather mild expression differences for making definitive conclusions. This is likely because the number of comparable cross-gender old adults enrolled in this study was small. Also, the core dataset in this study was derived from distinct participants from predefined age groups. Longitudinal data generated from the same set of donors would be more desirable for eliminating individual variation.\n\nIn the TCR aspect, na\u00efve T-cell TCR repertoire measurement might be an insightful biomarker specifically for frailty. Interestingly, a reasonable number of TCR clonotypes was identified in two or more T-cell subsets. These T cells from the same origin started to express different genes with distinct function during aging, combined with the dramatically shrunk TCR repertoire from 106 to 104, indicated the resiliency of the T-cell pool with the pluripotency capability of the remaining T cells in the aged individuals. The gained cytotoxic function of CD4+ T cells in super-centenarians reported before also suggested the resiliency of T cells in immune aging36. The identified CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in frail individuals, together with the widely reported cross-reaction of CMV-specific TCR to other antigen epitopes37, further supported the pluripotency and resilience capability of aged T cells during human aging.\n\nWe also showed immune cells have the potential of falling into diverging aging trajectories. Cells from age-matched old and frail donors were often mutually exclusively mapped to a distinct section of the trajectory pseudotime scale. Even when cells from old and frail groups were mapped with similar pseudotime (for example, na\u00efve T cells), they still exhibited a distinguishable transcriptome profile. Trajectory analysis also aided the discovery of enrichment of exhausted NK cells associated with frailty. This frail-specific characteristics and the expression signatures of immune cells from frailty (for example, NR4A3 and SRM globally, and NEAT1 and MALAT1 for T cells and monocytes) could be used to formulate a clinically relevant panel for prediction of unhealthy aging.\n\nMapping cell types by scRNA-seq technology can help uncover rare or previously undiscovered cell subtypes38. We discovered a frailty-specific monocyte subset in the frail group, with high expression of NEAT1 and MALAT1. In addition to participating in the assembly and maintenance of nuclear speckles, NEAT1 and MALAT1 also are associated with some age-related diseases, including cancer29, age-related memory impairment39 and myositis40. In addition, expression of NEAT1 and MALAT1 was abnormally increased in monocytes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus31,41. The overexpression of NEAT1 also demonstrated senescence and inflammatory characteristics in cultured cells. Moreover, other DE genes of frail monocytes were enriched for the inflammatory response and aging. These findings potentially imply these frailty-specific monocytes were related to the deterioration of the immune status and unhealthy condition of frail patients.\n\nTo sum up, our study provides insights into the discovery of a new cell type, specific cell markers and global genomics resources of immune aging and frailty. Further studies may focus on linking molecular changes of individual cell types to physiological phenotypes of aging and frailty, identifying the causality between different molecular changes, and explaining the pathogenetic mechanism of frailty.",
