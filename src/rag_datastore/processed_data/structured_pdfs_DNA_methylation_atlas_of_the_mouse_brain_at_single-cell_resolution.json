    "abstract": "The regulatory DNA landscape underlying the extensive heterogeneity of mammalian brain cells is poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing to profile 103,982 nuclei from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum, and olfactory areas. The atlas identifies 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets, constructs taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotates them with signature genes, regulatory elements, and transcription factors, and integrates multi-omic datasets to establish the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.",

            "content": "Epigenomic dynamics are associated with cell differentiation and maturation in the mammalian brain and have an essential role in regulating neuronal functions and animal behaviour 5 , 6 . Cytosine DNA methylation (5mC) is a stable covalent modification that persists in post-mitotic cells throughout their lifetime and is critical for proper gene regulation 6 . In mammalian genomes, 5mC occurs predominantly at CpG sites (mCG), showing dynamic patterns at regulatory elements with tissue and cell-type specificity 1 , 6 , 7 , 8 , modulating binding affinity of transcription factors 9 and controlling gene transcription 5 . Non-CpG cytosines are also abundantly methylated (mCH, H denotes A, C, or T)\u2014uniquely in neurons\u2014in the mouse and human brain 6 , 10 , which can directly affect DNA binding of methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) 11 , 12 , 13 , causing Rett syndrome 14 . Levels of mCH at gene bodies are anti-correlated with gene expression and show high heterogeneity across neuronal cell types 1 , 7 . A deeper understanding of epigenomic diversity in the mouse brain provides a complementary approach to transcriptome-based profiling methods for identifying brain cell types and allows genome-wide prediction of the regulatory elements and transcriptional networks underlying this diversity. Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of studying brain cell types and regulatory diversity using single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq) 1 . This study uses snmC-seq2 2 to perform thorough methylome profiling with detailed spatial dissection in the adult postnatal day 56 (P56) male mouse brain. In Li et al. 3 , the same tissue samples were profiled using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) to identify genome-wide accessible chromatin 15 , providing complementary epigenomic information to aid in cell-type-specific regulatory genome annotation. Moreover, to further study cis -regulatory elements and their potential target genes across the genome, we applied single-nucleus methylation and chromosome conformation capture sequencing (sn-m3C-seq) 4 to profile the methylome and chromatin conformation in the same cells. These epigenomic datasets provide a detailed and comprehensive census of the diversity of cell types across mouse brain regions, allowing identification of cell-type-specific regulatory elements and their candidate target genes and upstream transcription factors. Here we construct a single-cell base-resolution DNA methylation dataset containing 103,982 methylomes from 45 dissected brain regions and use an iterative analysis framework to identify 161 predicted mouse brain subtypes. Comparing subtype-level methylomes enables us to identify 3.9 million genomic regions showing cell-type-specific mCG variation, covering approximately 50% (1,240 Mb) of the mouse genome. We show that differentially methylated transcription factor genes and binding motifs can be associated with subtype taxonomy branches, allowing the prediction of cell-type gene regulatory programs specific for each developmental lineage. Integration of these data with cell clusters identified on the basis of chromatin accessibility validates most methylome-derived subtypes, enabling the prediction of 1.6 million enhancer-like genomic regions. We identify cis -regulatory interactions between enhancers and genes using computational prediction and single-cell chromatin conformation profiling (in the hippocampus (HIP)). We also identify spatial methylation gradients in cortical excitatory neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells and associated transcription factors and motifs. We apply an artificial neural network (ANN) model to precisely predict single-neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location using its methylome profile as input and develop the brain cell methylation viewer ( http://neomorph.salk.edu/omb ) as a portal for querying and visualization of cell- and cluster-level methylation data.",

In total, we analysed 45 dissected regions in two replicates (Extended Data Fig. 1 , Supplementary Table 2 ). Fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) of antibody-labelled nuclei was applied to capture NeuN-positive neurons (NeuN+, 92% of neurons), while also sampling a smaller number of NeuN-negative (NeuN\u2013, 8% of neurons) non-neuronal cells (Fig. 1a ). In total, we profiled the DNA methylomes of 103,982 single nuclei, yielding, on average, 1.5 million stringently filtered reads per cell (1.50 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 0.58 \u00d7 106, mean \u00b1 s.d.) covering 6.2 \u00b1 2.6% of the cytosines in the mouse genome in each cell.

The global methylation levels range from 0.2% to 7.6% in non-CpG sites and 61.6% to 88.8% in CpG sites (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c ). On the basis of the mCH and mCG profiles in 100-kb bins throughout the genome, we performed a three-level iterative clustering analysis to categorize the epigenomic cell populations (Fig. 1f, g ). After quality control and preprocessing (Methods), in the first level (cell class), we clustered 103,982 cells as 67,472 (65%) excitatory neurons, 28,343 (27%) inhibitory neurons, and 8,167 (8%) non-neurons (Supplementary Table 3 ). The second round of iterative analysis of each cell class identified 41 cell major types in total (cluster size range 95\u201311,919), and the third round separated these major types further into 161 cell subtypes (cluster size range 12\u20136,551).",

The overlap scores between unbiased (snmC-seq2) and targeted (epi-retro-seq) profiling experiments (Extended Data Fig. 5j ) indicate that some subtypes identified from the same cortical area show different projection specificity. For example, SSp and MOp neurons were mainly enriched in three subtypes marked by Kcnh1 , Tmtc2 and Nectin1 , respectively. However, neurons projecting to the medulla in the MOp and SSp only integrate with the subtype marked with Kcnh1 (Fig. 2j ), suggesting that the subtypes identified in unbiased methylome profiling have distinct projection specificities.",

This gradient correlated with the anterior\u2013posterior position of brain sections. Granule cells from the most posterior DG regions had higher global methylation than cells from anterior regions (Fig. 5d ). mCH accumulates throughout the genome during postnatal brain development 6 , 8 . We reasoned that DG granule cells, which are continuously replenished by ongoing neurogenesis throughout the lifespan, may accumulate mCH during their post-mitotic maturation.

This comprehensive dataset enables high-throughput cell-type classification, marker gene prediction and identification of regulatory elements. The three-level iterative clustering defined 161 subtypes representing excitatory (68), inhibitory (77) and non-neuronal cells (16). The development of a hierarchical taxonomic architecture for cell subtypes on the basis of CH-DMGs allowed us to assign specific genes and transcription factor binding motifs to taxonomy branches using the methylation impact score. These assignments describe cell-type specificity at different levels, potentially relating to different developmental stages of each neuronal lineage. Notably, we found that transcription factor genes and their corresponding DNA-binding motifs were co-associated with the same branch in the taxonomy, providing a rich source of candidate transcription factors for future study. Through integration with snATAC-seq 3 , we matched subtypes classified in both epigenomic modalities and used the combined information to predict 1.6 million active-enhancer-like eDMRs, including 72% of cell-type-specific elements missed from previous tissue-level bulk studies 8 . To examine the associations of eDMRs and their targeting genes, we applied multi-omic methods to establish an eDMR\u2013gene landscape using correlation-based prediction and chromatin conformation profiling using sn-m3C-seq, resulting in the identification of chromatin loops between eDMRs and their potential targeting genes in specific cell types.
