        "Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple datasets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq datasets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across datasets and downstream comparative analysis. Implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (), we use our approach to align scRNA-seq datasets of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell ‘atlases’ generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution."

        "With recent improvements in cost and throughput[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R1)–[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R3), and the availability of fully commercialized workflows[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R4), high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics has become an accessible and powerful tool for unbiased profiling of complex and heterogeneous systems. In concert with novel computational approaches, these datasets can be used for the discovery of cell types and states[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R5),[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R6), the reconstruction of developmental trajectories and fate decisions[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R7),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R8), and to spatially model complex tissues[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R9),[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R10). Indeed, scRNA-seq is poised to transform our understanding of developmental biology and gene regulation[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R11)–[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R14), and enable systematic reconstruction of cellular taxonomies across the human body[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R6),[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R15), although substantial computational obstacles remain. In particular, integrated analysis of different scRNA-seq datasets consisting of multiple transcriptomic subpopulations, either to compare heterogeneous tissues across different conditions or to integrate measurements produced by different technologies, remains challenging.",
        "Many powerful methods address individual components of this problem. For example, zero-inflated differential expression tests have been tailored to scRNA-seq data to identify changes within a single cell type[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R16),[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R17), and clustering approaches[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R18)–[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R23) can detect proportional shifts across conditions if cell types are conserved. However, comparative analysis for scRNA-seq poses a unique challenge, as it is difficult to distinguish between changes in the proportional composition of cell types in a sample and expression changes within a given cell type, and simultaneous analysis of multiple datasets will confound these two disparate effects. Therefore, new methods are needed that can learn jointly between multiple datasets and facilitate comparative analysis downstream. Progress towards this goal is essential for translating the oncoming wealth of single-cell sequencing data into biological insight. An integrated computational framework for joint learning between datasets would allow for robust and insightful comparisons of heterogeneous tissues in health and disease, integration of data from diverse technologies, and comparison of single-cell data from different species.",
        "Here, we present a novel computational strategy for integrated analysis of scRNA-seq datasets, motivated by techniques in computer vision designed for the alignment and integration of imaging datasets[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R24),[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R25). We demonstrate that multivariate methods designed for ‘manifold alignment’[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R26),[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R27) can be successfully applied to scRNA-seq data to identify gene–gene correlation patterns that are conserved across datasets and can embed cells in a shared low-dimensional space. We identify and compare 13 aligned PBMC subpopulations under resting and interferon β (IFN-β)–stimulated conditions, align scRNA-seq datasets of complex tissues produced across multiple technologies, and jointly learn shared cell types from droplet-based ‘atlases’ of human and mouse pancreatic tissue. These analyses pose distinct challenges for alignment, but in each case we successfully integrate the datasets and learn deeper biological insight than would be possible from individual analysis. Our approach can be applied to datasets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of cells, is compatible with diverse profiling technologies, and is implemented as part of Seurat, an open-source R toolkit for single-cell genomics."

        "We aimed to develop a diverse integration strategy that could compare scRNA-seq datasets across different conditions, technologies, or species. To be successful in diverse settings, this computational strategy must fulfill the following requirements, as illustrated with a toy example where heterogeneous scRNA-seq datasets are generated in the presence or absence of a drug ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F1)). First, subpopulations must be aligned even if each has a unique drug response. This key challenge lies outside of the scope of batch correction methods developed for bulk assays, which assume that confounding variables have uniform effects on all cells in a dataset. Second, the method must allow for changes in cellular density (shifts in subpopulation frequency) between conditions. Third, the method must be robust to changes in feature scale across conditions, allowing either global transcriptional shifts, or differences in normalization strategies between datasets produced with different technologies (i.e. UMI vs. FPKM). Lastly, the process should not be targeted towards defined cell subsets, with no requirement for pre-established sets of markers that can be used to match subpopulations."

        "The Seurat alignment workflow takes as input a list of at least two scRNA-seq datasets, and briefly consists of the following steps ([Figure 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F1)–[C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F1); [Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)).

(ii) As an optional step, it identifies individual cells that cannot be well described by this shared structure. This can help to identify rare populations that may be non-overlapping between the datasets, and can therefore be flagged for further analysis. (iii) It aligns the datasets into a conserved low-dimensional space, using non-linear ‘warping’ algorithms to normalize for differences in feature scale, in a manner that is robust to shifts in population density. (iv) It proceeds with an integrated downstream analysis, for example, identifying discrete subpopulations through clustering, or reconstructing continuous developmental processes ([Figure 1C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F1)). (v) It performs comparative analysis on aligned subpopulations between the datasets, to identify changes in population density or gene expression ([Figure 1C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F1)). We describe these steps briefly below, and then apply and validate this strategy on five sets of scRNA-seq experiments from the literature."

        "Machine-learning techniques for ‘data fusion’ aim to integrate information from multiple experiments into a consistent representation. For example, CCA aims to find linear combinations of features across datasets that are maximally correlated, identifying shared correlation structures across datasets[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R28),[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R29). CCA has been used for multi-modal genomic analysis from bulk samples, for example identifying relationships between gene expression and DNA copy number measurements based on the same set of samples[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R30). Here, in contrast to its traditional use in multi-modal analysis[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R31),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R32), we apply CCA to identify relationships between single cells from different datasets based on the same set of genes. Effectively, we treat the datasets as multiple measurements of a gene-gene covariance structure, and search for patterns that are common to the datasets. We use CCA for pairwise integration of two datasets, and extend this to multi-set CCA (i.e. Multi-CCA)[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R33),[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R34) for the integration of multiple datasets. In the description of all methods below, we refer only to CCA for simplicity, but note that each of the individual techniques can extend to Multi-CCA when multiple datasets are included as input ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)).",
        "We employ a variant of CCA, diagonal CCA, to account for cases where there are more cells than genes, and apply this using the single-cell RNA-seq datasets as input. The procedure can consider any gene that is measured across all datasets, though we choose to focus only on genes that exhibit high single cell variation in at least one dataset ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)). CCA identifies sets of canonical ‘basis’ vectors, embedding cells from each dataset in a low-dimensional space, such that the variation along these vectors (gene-level projections) is highly correlated between datasets. We note that CCA is robust to affine transformations in the original data, and is unaffected by linear shifts in gene expression (for example, due to different normalization strategies)."

        "CCA returns vectors whose gene-level projections are correlated between datasets, but not necessarily aligned. While linear transformations may be required to correct for global shifts in feature scale or normalization strategy, non-linear shifts may also be needed to correct for shifts in population density. We therefore align the CCA basis vectors between the datasets, resulting in a single, integrated low-dimensional space. Briefly, we represent each basis vector as a ‘metagene’, defined as a weighted expression average of the top genes whose expression exhibits robust correlations with the basis vector ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)). We first linearly transform the ‘metagenes’ to match their 95% reference range ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)), correcting for global differences in feature scale. Next, we determine a mapping between the metagenes using ‘dynamic time warping’, which locally compresses or stretches the vectors during alignment to correct for changes in population density[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R35). We apply this procedure to each pair (or set, for multiple alignment) of basis vectors individually, defining a single, aligned, low-dimensional space representing all datasets. This enables us to perform integrated downstream analyses, including unbiased clustering and the reconstruction of developmental trajectories, as demonstrated below."

Since all cells contain machinery to respond to IFN-β, stimulation results in a drastic but highly cell-type specific response. Consequently, a traditional joint analysis yields confusing results, as cells tend to cluster both by cell type but also by stimulation condition ([Figure 2A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2)). As an alternative to unbiased clustering, a supervised strategy to assign cells to classes based on known markers resulted in a final set of eight clusters[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R36)."

        "In contrast, the Seurat alignment returned a set of canonical correlation vectors that separated PBMC subsets irrespective of stimulation condition. We chose to include 20 vector pairs for downstream analysis ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)), but note that results for this and all examples in the manuscript were robust to the exact choice of this parameter ([Supplementary Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). We performed joint graph-based clustering on these aligned vectors and visualized the results with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to verify that cells grouped entirely by cell type and were properly aligned across conditions ([Figure 2B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2)). Our analysis revealed 13 cell clusters, which included the eight immune subsets described in the original publication, but separated additional populations as well ([Figure 2C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2); [Supplementary Data 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD4)). In particular, we were able to separate naïve from memory T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) from conventional dendritic cells, and identify an extremely rare (0.4%) population of contaminating erythroblasts. In addition, for T cells and B cells, we discovered activated subpopulations marked by a strong stress response expression signature that is likely an artifact of the culturing process in both conditions ([Supplementary Figure 2A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)–[B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). We verified the identity of our clusters by examining the expression of canonical cell-type markers (i.e _CD3D_ for T cells, _CD79A_ for B cells), that were conserved across conditions ([Figure 2D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2); [Supplementary Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)).",
        "Having aligned the datasets, we next sought to compare how PBMCs vary in response to IFN-β. As both conditions were drawn from the same pool of cells, we observed a strikingly similar proportional representation of all clusters in stimulated and control experiments (R=0.997; [Figure 2E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2)). However, each cell type exhibited significant changes upon IFN-β stimulation. Applying single cell differential expression tests separately for each cluster, we were able to identify constitutive markers of the IFN-β response induced in all cells (_ISG15_ , _IFIT1_), as well as components of the IFN-β response that varied across cell types (i.e., _CXCL10_ was activated primarily in myeloid cells upon stimulation) ([Figure 2D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2)). We noted that even canonical cell-type markers such as _CD14_ were differentially expressed by monocytes (1.98-fold down-regulation; [Supplementary Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)) in response to stimulation, highlighting the value of our non-targeted analyses in initially classifying cells.",
        "Focusing in on the novel subsets we were able to resolve, we compared the IFN-β response program between naïve and memory CD4+ T cells, and observed nearly identical response signatures ([Supplementary Figure 4A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). However, while we observed a general correlation between pDC and DC responses, we also saw stark differences that reproduced across patients ([Figure 2F](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2)). When comparing the IFN-β responses across all cell types, we observed that myeloid and lymphoid cells strongly clustered together, but pDC exhibited a distinct response to IFN-β and clustered separately ([Figure 2G](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F2); [Supplementary Figure 4B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)).",
        "We externally validated these findings by replicating the setup and stimulation of the original experiment, sorting populations of pDC and DC using standard surface markers ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)), and performing bulk RNA experiments in triplicate on stimulated and control cells. These bulk experiments strongly confirmed our single cell predictions: genes that were differentially regulated by IFN-β stimulation exhibited strikingly similar patterns in both the single cell and bulk datasets, and the bulk samples clustered directly with _in silico_ averaged data from the same cell type ([Supplementary Figure 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3); [Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)). Therefore, in a single transcriptome-wide analysis, our alignment procedure sensitively identified shared cell states through integrated clustering, and allowed for the identification of cell-type specific response modules that are likely to play important roles _in vivo_ during immune response to infection."

        "In the previous example, identical cell populations were used as input for both populations, and the cell subpopulations should therefore be fully overlapping. We wished to assess how our integration procedure would perform when non-overlapping populations were present in only one of the datasets. This is an important concern both for abundant populations, where absence in one dataset could throw off the integration, but also rare populations, which could blend in with an abundant cluster if unmatched, but may have significant biological importance.",
        "To address this, we performed two ‘in-silico’ experiments, where we artificially removed abundant (CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes; 38%), or rare (erythroblasts; 0.5%) cells from the stimulated dataset only, and repeated the alignment procedure. When we removed abundant populations, we observed negligible effects on the overall clustering and both CD14+ and CD16+ control monocytes were readily identified by visualization and graph-based clustering despite being present in only one dataset ([Supplementary Figure 6 A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)–[C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)).",
        "After removing stimulated erythroblasts, we observed that control erythroblast cells no longer separated in the integrated analysis, while other populations were unaffected ([Supplementary Figure 6D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). We therefore aimed to design a new test to identify these cells as non-overlapping, so they could be flagged for further exploration downstream. We reasoned that while CCA may struggle to identify canonical correlation vectors that define rare subpopulations present in only one dataset, PCA may be able to separate these cells, as we have previously shown[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R3). Therefore, we quantify how well the low-dimensional space defined by CCA explains each cell’s expression profile, and compare this to PCA, which is performed on each dataset independently ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)). Cells where the percent variance explained is reduced by a user-defined cutoff in CCA compared to PCA are therefore defined by strong sources of variance that are not shared between the datasets. We use a cutoff of 50% for all examples in this manuscript to identify these cells.",
        "This procedure enabled us to sensitively identify a rare group of non-overlapping cells in the control population, all of which could be identified as expressing high levels of _HBA1_ and _HBA2_ , and corresponded to the erythroblast population whose signal was previously blended into the rest of the data ([Supplementary Figure 6E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). Notably, this test correctly did not flag similar cells when applied to the original analysis of the full datasets (where the populations were fully overlapping), or in the _in silico_ monocyte removal (where the aligned canonical correlation vectors enabled the identification of both rare and abundant cell states). Taken together, we conclude that our integration procedure is robust to abundant non-overlapping populations, and can also identify rare populations that are present in a single dataset, enabling further characterization."

We observed that early megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells, identified in the original SMART-Seq2 publication, mapped exclusively onto erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors in the MARS-Seq data (Clusters C1–7). Similarly, SMART-Seq2 granulocyte-macrophage progenitors mapped onto basophil, eosinophil, dendritic cell, neutrophil, and monocyte progenitors (C11–18). While the MARS-Seq data specifically enriched for myeloid cells, the authors identified populations of very early progenitors that were FLT3+ (C9–10). These cells represent lympho-myeloid component progenitors (lymphoid-primed multi-potent progenitors (LMPP))[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R39), and early lymphoid progenitors from the SMART-Seq2 data mapped exclusively to these clusters.

        "Lastly, as both datasets identified developmentally heterogeneous populations during erythroid differentiation (broken into 7 stages in the MARS-Seq analysis), we applied diffusion maps to erythroid-committed cells to reconstruct a joint developmental trajectory ([Figure 3G](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F3)). We observed that this developmental path maintained the ‘pseudotemporal’ ordering of cells within both datasets ([Supplementary Figure 9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)) and also aligned the two together, exhibiting nearly identical expression dynamics for canonical differentiation markers ([Figure 3H](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F3)). Extending this analysis globally, we observed that gene expression changes across the trajectory were largely conserved between datasets, particularly for well-characterized effectors of erythropoiesis, yet we also saw technology-specific effects -- for example a strong JUN/FOS response that has previously been associated with cellular stress during scRNA-seq[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R40) ([Figure 3H](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F3)–[I](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F3)). Therefore, our procedure can successfully align both discrete and transitioning populations, and enable the identification of gene-expression programs that are conserved or unique to individual datasets.",
        "The ability to pool datasets of the same heterogeneous tissues has the potential to enable similar ‘meta-analyses’ for datasets produced across multiple labs and technologies. To further demonstrate this we include two additional examples ([Supplementary Figure 10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)), demonstrating the integration of human pancreatic islets produced with four plate-based scRNA-seq technologies (CelSeq, CelSeq2, Fluidigm C1, SmartSeq2), and human PBMCs produced with three distinct technologies (10X Genomics 3’ assay, 10X Genomics 5’ assay, and the Illumina/BioRad ddSeq). In the first example, we identify 8 populations of endocrine, exocrine, and stellate cells, clearly defined by cell-type specific markers that were conserved across technologies ([Supplementary Figure 10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). Notably, we also identified a rare population (1%) of endothelial cells which were present in all datasets, but whose rarity precluded their automated annotation in three of the four original analyses. As each sample was also from a different human donor, the proportion of cell types in each sample was highly variable, but did not confound the integration procedure ([Supplementary Figure 10E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)).",
        "In the second example, pooling the datasets yielded 16,653 PBMCs, allowing us to identify 16 immune populations, including 6 T cell clusters ([Supplementary Figure 11A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)–[D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)), and a rare subpopulation (0.5% frequency) of NK cells. This subpopulation lacked _FCGR3A_ expression but was enriched for _XCL1_ and _GZMK_ , consistent with highly cytotoxic CD56bright NK cells[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R41) ([Supplementary Figure 11E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). As with previous examples, the rarity of these cells precludes their identification in any individual dataset, and they were not identified in a previous analysis of 68,000 PBMCs[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R4). These integrated datasets provide the opportunity to perform ‘meta-analyses’ for differential expression across multiple technologies. As an example of this, we first performed individual ‘within-dataset’ differential expression tests, and then combined the results ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)). Using this approach to identify differential gene expression (DE) between NK cell subsets, we were able to more than triple the number of DE genes detected between these two cell groups ([Supplementary Figure 11F](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)), including lowly expressed markers but functionally important chemokines (_CCL5_), transcriptional regulators (_RORA_), and surface receptors (_FCRL6_). Therefore, pooling cells produced by integrating different scRNA-seq technologies not only boosts the statistical power to discover rare cell phenotypes, but also to identify transcriptomic markers of cell state."

        "As a final example, we tested the ability of Seurat to align heterogeneous populations from the same tissue, but originating from different species. We examined a recent single cell study of both human and mouse pancreatic islets, performed with the inDrop technology[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R1), that identified islet cell types independently in both species[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R42). The study found that cell-type transcriptomes were poorly conserved between human and mouse (avg. correlation between bulk transcriptomes of individual cell types: R=0.42), often finding very few strongly expressed markers that were preserved between species. This widespread divergence poses significant challenges for integration, as structure in the dataset was largely driven by species as well as by individual donor ([Figure 4A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F4), [Supplementary Figure 12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)).

        "Indeed, Seurat alignment identified canonical correlation vectors that separated cell types, identifying primarily small populations of immune cells (human mast cells and murine B cells) as ‘non-overlapping’ ([Figure 4B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F4), [Supplementary Figure 12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)). We next performed a single integrated clustering analysis, identifying 10 clusters, corresponding to alpha, delta, gamma, acinar, stellate, ductal, epithelial, immune, and two subgroups of beta cells ([Figure 4C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F4); [Supplementary Data 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3), [Supplementary Figure 9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3)).

We were also able to identify a subset of cell type markers that were conserved between human and mouse ([Figure 4D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F4)–[E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F4)).",
        "Notably, our procedure identified a rare subpopulation of beta cells in both human and mouse. These cells expressed identical levels of _INS_ , but up-regulated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes (_HERPUD1_ ; _GADD45A_) in both species ([Figure 4F](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F4)). A similar signal was observed in a semi-supervised analysis of the human beta cells in the original manuscript[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R42), but could not be detected in automated clustering, or an independent analysis of the murine dataset. In contrast, our integrated analyses reveal a conserved set of markers that are strikingly enriched for regulators of ER stress response to unfolded proteins[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R43),[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R44) ([Figure 4G](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#F4)), which has been shown to play an important role in the onset and progression of diabetes. Notably, expression of the transcription factors _ATF3_ and _ATF4_ was highly up-regulated in both species, representing factors that have well-established roles in the initiation of stress responses in the pancreas[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R45),[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R46). Taken together, these results demonstrate that our alignment procedure can identify shared cell states even in the face of significant global transcriptional shifts, driven in this case by millions of years of evolution."

To evaluate each technique, we designed an ‘alignment score’, which examines the local neighborhood of each cell after alignment ([Online Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#S12)).

The differences between these procedures were particularly striking when the transcriptomic differences between datasets (i.e ‘batch effect’) significantly outweighed differences between cell types (‘biology’), as in cross-species integration. However, when we attempted to align datasets from different tissues as a negative control, we observed poor results and low alignment scores, even when cells are not automatically classified as ‘non-overlapping’ ([Supplementary Figure 15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#SD3))."

        "We have developed a strategy to integrate scRNA-seq datasets by identifying shared sources of variation, corresponding to subpopulations present in multiple experiments. Implemented in the R toolkit Seurat, our procedure tackles several technical challenges, including the unbiased identification of shared gene–gene correlations across datasets, as well as the alignment of canonical correlation vectors using non-linear ‘warping’ algorithms.",
        "Dataset integration represents a key step in a general framework for case/control studies performed with single-cell resolution. As new datasets are generated, we expect that similar computational analyses will not only be invaluable for characterizing the immune system’s response to vaccination, inflammatory disease, and cancer, but also provide deeper insight into how genetic variation and manipulation affect heterogeneous populations. Similarly, we anticipate that these methods will enable consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R15),[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R42),[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R51), which aims to define all human cell types by integrating data generated across diverse single-cell ‘omics’ approaches, to combine datasets produced across many labs and technologies. Recent benchmarking studies of diverse scRNA-seq[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R52),[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R53) technologies have consistently demonstrated that no single method is uniformly superior, but rather, that each has individual strengths and weaknesses, further highlighting the potential value of data integration.",
        "We demonstrate the ability to align differentiated cell types between human and mouse pancreatic islets, identifying a shared population of beta cells responding to ER protein misfolding stress. These and similar analyses may provide invaluable comparative tools for studies utilizing mouse models of human disease, potentially enabling the identification of human correlates of pathogenic populations discovered in mouse (or vice versa). Furthermore, new datasets will enable the alignment and comparison of developmental trajectories across species, leading to a deeper understanding of how the gene regulatory networks generating cellular diversity are rewired across evolution. As comparative genomics has played a fundamental role in our understanding of the human genome, we believe that cross-species analyses may yield to similar insights towards our understanding of cellular diversity.",
        "Lastly, we note many challenges that future methods will address in extending this work. Although our procedure can robustly integrate multiple datasets with overlapping and non-overlapping populations, future datasets that consist of tens to hundreds batches with dramatically varying sizes and non-overlapping populations will likely require new methods. We also note that examples in this manuscript, including datasets with tens of thousands of cells, run in less than half an hour on a standard laptop computer, but new datasets extending to millions of cells may require advanced computation, subsampling, or newly optimized techniques for integration. Lastly, whereas we focus here on alignment of sequencing-based datasets, the recent invention of spatially resolved or _in-situ_ methods for transcriptomic profiling[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R54)–[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R56) raise the potential for integration with scRNA-seq datasets, including the ability to extend previous efforts to spatially resolve scRNA-seq data[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R9),[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6700744#R10) towards an unsupervised procedure generalizable to any tissue."

This is likely due to the fact that when only small numbers of genes are considered, biological stochasticity or technical noise will play a larger role in the pooled metagene. Therefore, the minimum number of genes that are required to have conserved expression patterns between datasets, in order to be correctly aligned, will depend on the scale and sequencing depth of each dataset.

Specifically, for each dataset _X_ _n_ and each CC vector _w_ _n_ , we examined all genes involved in the construction of the “metagene” (as described above, _M_ = _m_ 1, …,_m_ _g_) and calculated the average biweight midcorrelation.
