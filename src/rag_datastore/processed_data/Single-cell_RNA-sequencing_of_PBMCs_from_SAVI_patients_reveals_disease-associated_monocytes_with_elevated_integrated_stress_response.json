Although elevated [type I interferon](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/interferon-type-i \"Learn more about type I interferon from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (IFN) production is thought to be the leading cause of the symptoms observed in patients, STING can induce a set of pathways, which have roles in the onset and severity of SAVI and remain to be elucidated.

Of note, no overt decrease of effector T cells was observed in healthy PBMCs challenged _in vitro_ with type I IFN for 36 h ([Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig1)D, 1F, [S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)H, and S1J).",

After _in vitro_ stimulation with IFN-β, a robust type I IFN response is measured, peaking after 2 h ([Figures 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig2)B and [S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)B), with the strongest type I IFN response persisting at later time points in [monocytes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/monocyte \"Learn more about monocytes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and DCs.

Under [JAK](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/janus-kinase \"Learn more about JAK from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") inhibitor treatment, NF-κB activation was back to CTRL levels.

        "To explore the dysregulated pathways in SAVI patients, we performed differential expression and pathway analysis between untreated SAVI and CTRLs in each major cell population. We observed, in most cell types, an enrichment in pathways involved in response to IFNs and/or linked to inflammation ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig2)E; [Table S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc2)) that were downregulated by JAK inhibitors but remained higher than in CTRLs ([Figures S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)A and S2C; [Table S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc2)). These pathways were also found to be activated in PBMCs treated with IFN-β for 36 h ([Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig2)F; [Table S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc3)). Cell death pathways were enriched in both SAVI patients and in PBMCs stimulated with IFN-β for 36 h. JAK inhibition also seemed to partially correct the induction of these cell death-related pathways ([Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)C). Interestingly, whereas actin/integrin-related pathways are predicted to be downregulated in all PBMCs in SAVI patients, in healthy PBMCs 36 h after IFN-β stimulation, these pathways are predicted to be upregulated in T and B cells while inhibited in monocytes and NK ([Figures 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig2)E and 2F). Additionally, in both PBMCs from SAVI patients and _in vitro_ -stimulated PBMCs, we observed a robust modulation of pathways linked to the ISR, with [downregulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/downregulation \"Learn more about downregulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of EIF2 signaling and [oxidative phosphorylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/oxidative-phosphorylation \"Learn more about oxidative phosphorylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as well as an upregulation of the [unfolded protein response](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/unfolded-protein-response \"Learn more about unfolded protein response from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (UPR). Of note, EIF2 signaling is predicted to be strongly inhibited in most cell types with the exception of T cells. In patients’ CD8+ T cells, EIF2 signaling is predicted to be activated both prior and during treatment, indicating JAK-STAT pathway-independent mechanism. In the IFN-β dataset, UPR was induced as soon as 4 h with increasing levels of induction throughout the time course. Meanwhile, ISR and EIF2 responses were inhibited in all populations in a time-dependent manner ([Figure S2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)D; [Table S3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc4)).",

It also pointed to actin and integrin-related pathways and particularly the leukocyte extravasation signaling ([Figure 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig3)A). Several other associated pathways, including RAC signaling and [integrin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/integrin \"Learn more about integrin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") signaling, were decreased in [effector cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/effector-cell \"Learn more about effector cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").

We also observed significantly decreased proportion of naive T cells from SAVI patients in the G2/M phase, partially rescued by the treatment, suggesting reduced proliferation capacity ([Figure S3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)C). Similarly, in the IFN-β dataset, IFN-β induced increased senescence and decreased proportion of cells in G2/M phase, even though the proportion of cell in the G2/M phase is back to normal after 36 h ([Figures 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig3)I and [S3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)D).

        "### Identification of disease-associated monocytes in SAVI patients, presenting hyperinflammation and transcriptomic signature of an ISR",
        "As type I IFN response and NF-κB signaling signature scores were predominantly detected in monocytes and DCs, we examined these populations in greater details. We observed a shift in the distribution of classical monocytes, without changes of global monocytes proportions ([Figures 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig1)G, [S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)G, S1I, [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)A, 4B, and [S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)A). Cluster 17, named “disease-associated cluster,” is composed at 85% of cells from patients, with 66.7% of cells from patients before JAK inhibitor treatment, and 18.3% of cells from patients under treatment ([Figures 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)B and [S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)A). In this disease-associated cluster ([Figure S1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)E), both type I IFN response score and NF-κB activation score were elevated. Other monocytes (clusters 5 and 12) from SAVI patients also had an elevated score for both signatures, although to a lesser extent ([Figure 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)C). Expression of type I and [type III IFNs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/interferon-type-iii \"Learn more about type III IFNs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") were increased in SAVI patients compared with CTRLs and partially decreased upon JAK inhibitor treatment ([Figure S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)B). In SAVI patients, we observed that disease-associated monocytes were the main source of IFN-β mRNA ([Figures 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)D and [S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)C). We then performed differential expression analysis between disease-associated monocytes of SAVI patients (cluster 17) and their classical monocytes (cluster 5). We observed 984 differentially expressed genes ([Figures 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)E and [S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)D; [Table S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc5)), with the upregulation of key players involved in the ISR, [cell activation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cell-activation \"Learn more about cell activation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and transcripts of pro-inflammatory cytokines including [IL1B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/il1b \"Learn more about IL1B from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and several type I IFNs (such as _IFNB1_ , _IFNA1_ , and _IFNA2_). Pathway analysis revealed a strong enrichment of genes negatively regulating the EIF2 [signaling pathway](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/signal-transduction \"Learn more about signaling pathway from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), which can be associated to increased ISR[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib23) ([Figures 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)F and [S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)D; [Table S5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc6)). To validate the upregulation of the ISR, we evaluated _PPP1R15A_ , which encodes the ISR marker GADD34. _PPP1R15A_ expression reached the highest level in the disease-associated monocytes of the SAVI group ([Figures 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)E and 4G). An UPR signature,[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib24) known to contribute to the ISR, was similarly upregulated in patients’ disease-associated monocytes. Notably, patients’ non-classical monocytes expressed increased _PPP1R15A_ and UPR signature score. JAK inhibitor treatments seem to partially reduce these pathways in both non-classical and disease-associated clusters ([Figure 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)G). In the stimulated monocytes of the IFN-β dataset, both _PPP1R15A_ and the UPR signature score were increased after 36 h of stimulation ([Figure S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)E). Among the other pathways upregulated in the disease-associated cluster, we report pathways linked to response to IFN, production of [inflammatory cytokines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/inflammatory-cytokine \"Learn more about inflammatory cytokines from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and cell death along with an enrichment of genes involved in [oxidative phosphorylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/oxidative-phosphorylation \"Learn more about oxidative phosphorylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Figure S4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)D).

        "### Cell-to-cell communication inference predicts that hyperinflammatory monocytes in SAVI could drive hyperactivation and death of effector T cells",
        "To better understand how monocytes from SAVI patients may influence T cells ([Figures 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig3) and [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)), we inferred monocyte-to-T cell communications. Thus, we used ICELLNET,[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib25) which computes a score of cell-to-cell communication based on the transcriptomic level of ligands expressed by a sender cell type (here, both clusters of classical monocytes: cluster 5 and cluster 17) and the transcriptomic level of their receptors expressed by a receiving cell type (here, T cells) ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)A). We applied this method to the SAVI dataset to infer communications between classical monocytes and each T cell cluster in the SAVI group and the CTRL group separately ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)B). We reproduced a similar analysis on the IFN-β dataset for each time point ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)C), allowing us to decipher IFN-dependent from IFN-independent predicted interactions. Hierarchical clustering of T cells based on their communication score with monocytes showed a clear separation between clusters from untreated SAVI patients and CTRLs ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)D). We observed a predicted increase of type I IFN-IFNAR interactions in SAVI patients, which probably reflects the drastic upregulation of IFN transcripts in the monocytes of SAVI patients ([Figure 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)D), although this interaction is not predicted in the IFN-β dataset ([Figures 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)D and 5E).

We also observed in SAVI patients and IFN-β stimulated cells increased communications involved in apoptosis induction with TNFSF10/TNFRSF10B and LGALS1/CD69 ([Figures 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)D and 5E).[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib29),[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib30) In CD8+ T [cell interactions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cell-cell-interaction \"Learn more about cell interactions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with monocytes, the pair MICA/KLRK1 was predicted to be increased both in SAVI patients and IFN-β stimulated cells, an interaction leading to [cell lysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cytolysis \"Learn more about cell lysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib31) ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)D). Overall, these data point toward a role of the disease-associated monocytes in favoring T cells chronic activation and death.",
        "### Circulating cytokines in the plasma of SAVI patients as biomarkers of the disease",
        "As several cytokines/chemokines were upregulated in SAVI patients at the transcriptomic level, we evaluated 96 inflammation-related proteins in both datasets using the [proteomic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/proteomics \"Learn more about proteomic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") proximity extension assays. We confirmed the previously known increase of IL-6[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib16) and observed increased plasmatic levels of [CXCL10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/cxcl10 \"Learn more about CXCL10 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and [CCL19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/ccl19 \"Learn more about CCL19 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)F), which were predicted to play a role in monocyte-to-T cell communications ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)D). Other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as [CCL3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ccl3 \"Learn more about CCL3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), [CCL4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ccl4 \"Learn more about CCL4 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), [CCL7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/ccl7 \"Learn more about CCL7 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and [CCL8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ccl8 \"Learn more about CCL8 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), were also increased in the plasma of SAVI patients compared with CTRLs ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)F). The secretory profile of PBMCs stimulated with IFN-β for 36 h was characterized by induction of CXCL10, VEGFA, and [CCL19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ccl19 \"Learn more about CCL19 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)G). To assess the correspondence between the protein and the mRNA levels of the cytokines measured in the plasma of SAVI patients, we evaluated the expression of the 12 cytokines found to be increased in the plasma of SAVI patients in the scRNA-seq data ([Figure 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)H). Our results suggest a strong role of the disease-associated monocytes in the secretion of several of these cytokines and, therefore, validate our cell-to-cell communication predictions ([Figures 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)H and [S5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)C). Of note, _[CCL3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/ccl3 \"Learn more about CCL3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")_ , _CCL4_ , and _IL-6_ were among the most upregulated genes in the disease-associated monocytes ([Figure 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig4)E). IFN-β-stimulated PBMCs had a more homogeneous expression of [inflammatory cytokines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/inflammatory-cytokine \"Learn more about inflammatory cytokines from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") across cell types, in particular monocytes, DCs, and NK cells ([Figures 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig5)I and [S5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)D). The specific elevation of type I IFN-independent cytokines, in particular CCL3, CCL4, and IL-6, suggests that they may be used as blood biomarkers of SAVI to aid the differential diagnosis with other type I interferonopathies.",
        "### A transcriptomic signature specific to STING activation and independent of response to IFN-β",
        "We next sought to identify a transcriptomic signature of STING activation, independent of response to IFN-β stimulation ([Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)A; [Table S6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc7)). The first step consisted in extracting the 95 genes most specific to the disease-associated monocytes cluster (step 1, [Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)B). One gene, _G0S2_ , was filtered out from the list as its expression was not increased in SAVI compared with CTRLs (step 2, [Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)C). To obtain a type I IFN-independent signature, another step of the workflow was removing all genes related to type I IFNs and type I IFN response. We first removed type I IFN transcripts that were found in the list (step 3, [Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)C) and genes upregulated by IFN-β at any time point of the IFN-β dataset, in monocytes and DCs (step 4, [Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)D). Consequently, 21 genes remained in the STING-activation signature ([Figure S6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)A). These genes were mostly associated with TNF-α signaling via NF-κB ([Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)E). We confirmed that this signature was specific to the SAVI patients, as compared with the CTRL group, and partially reduced in JAK inhibitor-treated patients ([Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)F). We also confirmed in the IFN-β dataset that the resulting signature score was not increased by type I IFN at any time point ([Figure S6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)B).",

        "To further evaluate the relevance of this signature in the context of STING activation, independent of type I IFN response, we designed an _in vitro_ model of STING activation, in which PBMCs from a CTRL were stimulated with ADUS100 (a STING agonist), with or without JAK inhibitor. After scRNA-seq, type I-IFN response and NF-κB activation signature score were both increased by ADUS100 and dampened by JAK inhibitor ([Figure S6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)C). We observed a strong increase of the STING-activation signature score in ADUS100-stimulated monocytes and DCs, which remained elevated under JAK inhibitor ([Figure 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig6)G). The STING activation signature score was restricted to monocyte and DCs in both the SAVI patients ([Figure S6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)D) and the ADUS100-stimulated PBMCs ([Figure S6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)E).",
        "Overall, this list of 21 genes may represent a signature specific to STING activation and independent of type I IFN response.",
        "### Identification of a second genetic variant in PERK in a SAVI patient with a low UPR",
        "While analyzing the [transcriptome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/transcriptome \"Learn more about transcriptome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of SAVI patients, we identified several pathways that were differentially modulated in P1. We noted, in this patient, a marked reduction of the UPR, which was largely increased in other patients ([Figure 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig7)A). Of note, IFN-β stimulation induced a slight increase of the UPR ([Figure S7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)A). This observation is accompanied by low expression of the ISR marker _PPP1R15A_ in monocytes and DCs ([Figure 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig7)B). Further exploration showed differences in induction of the apoptosis signature and NF-κB signaling, although less drastic than the UPR ([Figures 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig7)C and 7D). These differences are even observable when compared with P2, P1’s father’s [homozygotic twin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/monozygotic-twins \"Learn more about homozygotic twin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Figure S7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)E).

        "These observations prompted us to reanalyze the [exome sequencing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/exome-sequencing \"Learn more about exome sequencing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") previously performed for this patient, including her mother and her paternal uncle (P2).[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib1) We specifically explored the 85 genes of the UPR signature ([Figure 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig7)E). [Exome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/exome \"Learn more about Exome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis revealed [SNPs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/single-nucleotide-polymorphism \"Learn more about SNPs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in four genes: _CTH_ , _VEGFA_ , _ZCCHC8_ , and _[EIF2AK3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/eif2ak3 \"Learn more about EIF2AK3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")_ ([Figure 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig7)F). Variants in _CTH_ and _VEGFA_ are intronic or in [untranslated regions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/untranslated-region \"Learn more about untranslated regions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and, therefore, may not induce a change in protein function. In contrast, variants in _ZCCHC8_ and _EIF2AK3_ induced core changes in [amino acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/amino-acids \"Learn more about amino acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") chain and may be of importance. While the STING p.V155M mutation was inherited from the father, both variants were inherited from the healthy mother, suggesting they could play a role in the transcriptomic differences observed between P1 and her uncle P2, regarding the UPR signature score ([Figure S7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)E). However, the variant in _ZCCHC8_ had an allele count in the population higher than expected for a pathogenic variant (it was seen 110 times in gnomAD, giving an allele frequency of 0.000405), and ZCCHC8 seemed to be a downstream target of the UPR pathway. Therefore, we focused on the variant in _EIF2AK3_. This private [missense](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/missense \"Learn more about missense from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") variant (p.P649T) in _EIF2AK3_ , which encodes PERK, a key activator of the UPR, was confirmed by [Sanger sequencing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/sanger-sequencing \"Learn more about Sanger sequencing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Figure S7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc1)F). PERK was recently shown to be activated upon STING activation through direct interaction between its kinase domain and the C-terminal tail of STING.[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib20) Once activated, PERK induces the phosphorylation of key components of the ISR. The p.P649T variant carried is in the kinase domain of PERK, which carries the ISR-inducing function. Importantly, the UPR signature score of the mother who carries the variant (C9) appeared in T and B lymphocytes slightly lower than the score observed in the healthy paternal aunt (C8), who is not carrying the _EIF2AK3_ variant ([Figure 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#fig7)A). Overall, these findings support a potential causal effect of the p.P649T variant of PERK in the reduction of the UPR signature in P1."

We report that naive T cells are maintained in an early activation state, which concords with previous reports suggesting that T cells carrying a gain-of-function _STING1_ mutation are constitutively activated.[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib11),[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib32) While activation should prompt T [cell proliferation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cell-proliferation \"Learn more about cell proliferation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), we highlight increased activation of the senescence pathway in patients’ naive T cells, associated with decreased proportions of cells reaching the G2M phase of the cell cycle.

In addition, several studies have highlighted the ability of chronic IFN-β to trigger senescence[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib33),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib34) and our observations from the IFN-β dataset support these studies, although the decrease in cell cycle is only transiently observed. Moreover, we have observed an increase in apoptosis transcriptomic signature, suggesting that activated senescent T cells may head toward [programmed cell death](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/programmed-cell-death \"Learn more about programmed cell death from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). These results concur with the antiproliferative role of STING,[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib14) as well as its pro-senescence[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib10),[35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib35) and pro-apoptotic[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib1),[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib12),[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib14) roles. Altogether, our results could suggest that the decrease of effector T cells may result from the altered naive T cell compartment. We propose that naive T cells could lose their ability to transition into an effector state due to an hyperactivation state combined with premature senescence and apoptosis.",
        "Clustering of the SAVI dataset revealed a disease-associated cluster composed of 85% of patients’ cells. This cluster was of classical monocyte origin and presented an increased expression of activation and inflammatory markers. It had elevated GADD34 gene expression, an increased [UPR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/unfolded-protein-response \"Learn more about UPR from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") signature score, and decreased ribosomal genes expression, which altogether implies activation of the ISR. While our results did not allow us to conclude on the exact mechanism driving the ISR, the recent discovery of the direct activation by STING of an ISR mediator, PERK, suggests that this could be mediated through PERK.[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib20) PERK is an [ER stress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/endoplasmic-reticulum-stress \"Learn more about ER stress from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") sensor that, like inactivated STING, is found on the [ER membrane](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/endoplasmic-reticulum-membrane \"Learn more about ER membrane from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Upon unfolded protein sensing, PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, thereby triggering the ISR. Its direct activation by STING, independent of unfolded proteins, has recently been demonstrated in human cell lines and in mice, and was shown to be responsible for organ [fibrosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/fibrosis \"Learn more about fibrosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as well as cellular senescence, both hallmarks of SAVI.[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib20) These observations suggest that elevated [UPR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/unfolded-protein-response \"Learn more about UPR from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in this cluster reflects a STING-induced activation of PERK. However, as PERK is not the only trigger for UPR, we cannot exclude that other mechanisms are involved in these disease-associated [monocytes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/monocyte \"Learn more about monocytes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").",
        "Intriguingly, we observed in the patient P1, as opposed to other patients, a low UPR signature score. This observation helped us to reveal a [missense](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/missense \"Learn more about missense from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") p.P649T variant in _[EIF2AK3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/eif2ak3 \"Learn more about EIF2AK3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")_ , encoding PERK, inherited from her healthy mother. This residue lies in the kinase domain of PERK, which is responsible for eIF2α phosphorylation, a key event for the initiation of the ISR. This never-described variant was predicted to be highly deleterious, suggesting that it might be highly detrimental in combination with STING-activating mutations. As the kinase domain of PERK is responsible for eIF2α phosphorylation, it strengthens the importance of PERK-mediated ISR in disease-associated monocytes of SAVI patients.",
        "By inferring monocyte-to-T [cells interactions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cell-cell-interaction \"Learn more about cells interactions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"),[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib25) we provided clues that hyperinflammatory monocytes could promote activation of T cells, as well as cell death. We revealed the establishment of known T cell-activating signaling in SAVI patients, with increase of CCL19/CCR7 and LGALS1/CD69, which play a role in T cell activation.[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib26),[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib29) Additionally, we note several communications that trigger T cell death, such as TRAIL(_TNFSF10_)/TNFRSF10B[36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib36) or MIKA/KLRK1,[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib31) or involved in immune exhaustion such as [LAG3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/lag3 \"Learn more about LAG3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and its ligands.[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib28) These data point toward a potent role of the monocytes to prime T cells toward activation and cell death. Although these interactions were predicted at the transcriptomic level, several of the cytokines involved in the predicted monocyte-to-T cells communications were also elevated at the protein level in the plasma of SAVI patients.",
        "To further evaluate the relevance of the disease-associated cells in the pathogenesis of SAVI, we suggest that their presence should be investigated in the lungs of SAVI patients, as the role of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages is increasingly recognized in [pulmonary fibrosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/lung-fibrosis \"Learn more about pulmonary fibrosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib37),[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib38),[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib39),[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib40) The ISR has also been proposed as an important driver of pulmonary fibrosis,[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib41) which further supports the hypothesis that the disease-associated monocytes may drive the pulmonary damage in SAVI patients and could constitute an interesting indication for treatment monitoring. Other potential targets of interest in SAVI are PERK and the ISR, which are the targets of compounds under development for other diseases.[42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib42)",
        "While JAK inhibitors are beneficial to SAVI patients, they do not allow for complete remission, and patients with advanced lung disease prior to treatment show little to no amelioration.[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib3) Here, we have assessed the transcriptomic impact of JAK inhibition, supporting an incomplete impact of the treatment at the molecular level. In naive T cells, while treatments seemed to correct the senescence and apoptosis, they did not correct the activation of EIF2 signaling, nor restore the proportion of T cells to normal levels.",
        "Current diagnosis of type I interferonopathies, including SAVI, relies on [clinical evaluation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/clinical-trial \"Learn more about clinical evaluation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") followed by measurement of ISGs in PBMCs or whole blood of suspected patients. This approach is common to all type I interferonopathies, and subsequent sequencing (either Sanger or exome sequencing) is required to pinpoint a specific gene.[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib1) There is therefore an unmet need for an easy-to-use, differential diagnosis strategy between the different type I interferonopathies. We noticed elevated [CCL3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/ccl3 \"Learn more about CCL3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), CCL4, and IL-6 at the transcriptomic level in the disease-associated monocytes and at the protein level in the plasma, and we propose that they be added to the panel of six ISGs routinely measured at the transcriptomic level. Elevated expression of these cytokines associated with high ISG score could lead to a suspicion of _STING1_ gain-of-function mutation. In addition, we identified a STING-activation signature and have tested if it could serve as another tool to discriminate SAVI patients from other interferonopathies. We have observed that patients with SAVI had a uniquely high level of the signature compared with patients with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome or COPA syndrome (data not shown), reinforcing the specificity of that signature. Interestingly, [IL1B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/il1b \"Learn more about IL1B from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), encoding [inflammasome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/inflammasome \"Learn more about inflammasome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") activation marker IL-1β, is part of the STING activation signature, consistent with STING’s ability to induce [NLRP3 inflammasome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/nlrp3-inflammasome \"Learn more about NLRP3 inflammasome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") activation.[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib43) Even though the [inflammasome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/inflammasome \"Learn more about inflammasome from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") activates IL-1β at the protein level, IL-1β activation may lead to a positive feedback loop enhancing _IL1B_ gene expression.[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib44) Therefore, the presence of _IL1B_ in the STING activation signature may reflect the activation of [NLRP3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/nlr-family-pyrin-domain-containing-3 \"Learn more about NLRP3 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Furthermore, the SAVI signature may be relevant in the stratification of [SLE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/systemic-lupus-erythematosus \"Learn more about SLE from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") patients. Indeed, [SLE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/systemic-lupus-erythematosus \"Learn more about SLE from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") has been shown the represent not one disease but up to seven group of “sub-diseases,”[45](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib45) and STING may be activated in some patients.[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib46),[47](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib47) Thus, we think that our signature may bring new insights into SLE patient stratification.",
        "### Limitations of the study",
        "Our study has several limitations, including a low number of samples and the exclusive assessment of PBMCs, both caused by the rareness of SAVI patients and the consequent freezing of any blood sample. However, PBMCs exclude several cell types that may have been interesting to study in SAVI.[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib4) In endothelial cells, STING activation was shown to control T cells transendothelial migration,[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib48) potentially into the lungs.[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib49) Endothelial cells in patients’ lungs also display elevated immune functions,[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib19) further emphasizing their critical role in the SAVI pathogenesis. In addition, fibroblasts have also been implicated in lung fibrosis of SAVI patients.[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib50) Nonetheless, the view of the [immune system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/immune-system \"Learn more about immune system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") provided by PBMCs, even partial, has allowed to draw several meaningful conclusions regarding the pathogenesis of SAVI.",
        "To reinforce the analysis, we compared the results driven from these patients to a dataset of PBMC stimulated with IFN-β. The system that we have set up only represents the consequence of an acute IFN-β stimulation while SAVI is a [chronic disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/chronic-disease \"Learn more about chronic disease from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with an onset in the first weeks of life, making comparison of the molecular pathways challenging to interpret. However, comparing the patients’ PBMCs with the IFN-β stimulation PBMCs has led to several insights into disease pathogenesis.",
        "Finally, in an attempt to overcome the limitation of studying [proteomic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/proteomics \"Learn more about proteomic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") pathways at the transcriptomic level, we have used functional signatures composed of targets of a pathway, as opposed to components of said pathways. Nevertheless, some observations made on the transcriptomics data were validated in the plasma at the protein level. In addition, other papers have already reported at the protein level what we have observed at the transcriptomic level,[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib14) further reinforcing the strength of the [transcriptomic analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/gene-expression-profiling \"Learn more about transcriptomic analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").",
        "Despite these limitations, our results provide a deeper understanding of the dysregulated responses in patient [immune cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/immunocompetent-cell \"Learn more about immune cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and how monocytes and their downstream effect on T cells can reflect SAVI pathogenesis, as well as proposing biomarker candidates for the disease."

        "We performed analysis on 5 SAVI patients previously described clinically, as mentioned in the first paragraph of the results section, and selected for their gain-of-function mutations in _STING1_. Patients are female or male between 4 years old and 34 years old (P1, P2, P4, P5, P6), P2 being P1’s uncle. 7 healthy controls in the SAVI dataset were selected for their [absence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/epileptic-absence \"Learn more about absence from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of _STING1_ mutation and for matching age range of SAVI patients.

        "Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and aligned to the human reference genome (hg38), and counted using the CellRanger Pipeline v6.0. Unfiltered [RNA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/rna \"Learn more about RNA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") UMI counts were loaded into Seurat v4 for quality control, data integration and downstream analyses. Apoptotic cells and empty sequencing capsules were excluded by filtering out cells with low number of features (Filters were defined based on the batch: STING1: nFeature <300; STING2 and STING3 <500; IFN-stim <750) or a mitochondrial content higher than 20%. Data from each sample were normalized using sctransform, before batch correction using Seurat’s _FindIntegratedAnchors_ , on the 3,000 most variable features. For the IFN-β dataset, for computational efficiency, integration anchors were determined with a canonical correlation analysis, using all unstimulated samples as reference. For the SAVI dataset, to avoid over-aligning samples, a reciprocal [principal component analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/principal-component-analysis \"Learn more about principal component analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (PCA) was used to find integration anchors. On the resulting integrated datasets, we computed the PCA on the 3000 most variable genes, before computing a UMAP (on 20 PCs for SAVI and 30 PCs for IFN-stimulation). Community detection was performed using the graph-based modularity-optimization Louvain algorithm from Seurat’s _FindClusters_ function with a 1.2 resolution. Cell types labels were assigned to resulting clusters based on a manually curated list of marker genes as well as previously defined signatures of the PBMC subtypes.[53](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#bib51) Despite filtering for high quality cells, 11/34 clusters in the SAVI dataset and 7/36 in the IFN-β dataset stood out as poor quality clusters and were removed from further analysis. They represented low UMI cells, dying cells, cycling cells, doublets, or contaminants (progenitor cells, basophils, platelets or megakaryocytes). A total of 112,060 and 115,503 cells were kept in the SAVI and IFN-β datasets respectively. Transcriptomic signatures scores were calculated using Seurat’s _AddModuleScore_ function. The signatures and their origin are described in [Table S7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123005505#mmc2).

We combined together cluster 5 and cluster 17 into a single classical monocyte group and considered this group as the “central cells”. Each cluster of CD4+ or CD8+ T cell was considered as the “partner cells”. In the SAVI dataset, the predictions were performed separately for the CTRLs, the SAVI, and the SAVI_treated groups.
