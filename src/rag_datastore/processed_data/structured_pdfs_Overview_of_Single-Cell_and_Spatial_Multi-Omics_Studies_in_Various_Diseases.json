    "abstract": "This document provides an overview of studies utilizing single-cell and spatial multi-omics technologies across a range of diseases. It highlights the technologies used, the model organisms studied, and the main findings in areas such as cell atlas construction, pathway identification, novel target discovery, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell transfer (ACT), host-microbe interactions, infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease, and neurological and brain diseases. The studies reveal insights into disease mechanisms, potential therapeutic targets, and responses to treatments.",
