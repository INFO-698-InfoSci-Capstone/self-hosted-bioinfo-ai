        "Mammalian brain cells show remarkable diversity in gene expression, anatomy and function, yet the regulatory DNA landscape underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing[1],[2] to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data[3] enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer–gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments[4]. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum."

        "Epigenomic dynamics are associated with cell differentiation and maturation in the mammalian brain and have an essential role in regulating neuronal functions and animal behaviour[5],[6]. Cytosine DNA methylation (5mC) is a stable covalent modification that persists in post-mitotic cells throughout their lifetime and is critical for proper gene regulation[6]. In mammalian genomes, 5mC occurs predominantly at CpG sites (mCG), showing dynamic patterns at regulatory elements with tissue and cell-type specificity[1],[6],[7],[8], modulating binding affinity of transcription factors[9] and controlling gene transcription[5]. Non-CpG cytosines are also abundantly methylated (mCH, H denotes A, C, or T)—uniquely in neurons—in the mouse and human brain[6],[10], which can directly affect DNA binding of methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)[11],[12],[13], causing Rett syndrome[14]. Levels of mCH at gene bodies are anti-correlated with gene expression and show high heterogeneity across neuronal cell types[1],[7].",
        "A deeper understanding of epigenomic diversity in the mouse brain provides a complementary approach to transcriptome-based profiling methods for identifying brain cell types and allows genome-wide prediction of the regulatory elements and transcriptional networks underlying this diversity. Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of studying brain cell types and regulatory diversity using single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq)[1]. This study uses snmC-seq2[2] to perform thorough methylome profiling with detailed spatial dissection in the adult postnatal day 56 (P56) male mouse brain. In Li et al.[3], the same tissue samples were profiled using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) to identify genome-wide accessible chromatin[15], providing complementary epigenomic information to aid in cell-type-specific regulatory genome annotation. Moreover, to further study _cis_ -regulatory elements and their potential target genes across the genome, we applied single-nucleus methylation and chromosome conformation capture sequencing (sn-m3C-seq)[4] to profile the methylome and chromatin conformation in the same cells.",
        "These epigenomic datasets provide a detailed and comprehensive census of the diversity of cell types across mouse brain regions, allowing identification of cell-type-specific regulatory elements and their candidate target genes and upstream transcription factors. Here we construct a single-cell base-resolution DNA methylation dataset containing 103,982 methylomes from 45 dissected brain regions and use an iterative analysis framework to identify 161 predicted mouse brain subtypes. Comparing subtype-level methylomes enables us to identify 3.9 million genomic regions showing cell-type-specific mCG variation, covering approximately 50% (1,240 Mb) of the mouse genome. We show that differentially methylated transcription factor genes and binding motifs can be associated with subtype taxonomy branches, allowing the prediction of cell-type gene regulatory programs specific for each developmental lineage. Integration of these data with cell clusters identified on the basis of chromatin accessibility validates most methylome-derived subtypes, enabling the prediction of 1.6 million enhancer-like genomic regions. We identify _cis_ -regulatory interactions between enhancers and genes using computational prediction and single-cell chromatin conformation profiling (in the hippocampus (HIP)). We also identify spatial methylation gradients in cortical excitatory neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells and associated transcription factors and motifs. We apply an artificial neural network (ANN) model to precisely predict single-neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location using its methylome profile as input and develop the brain cell methylation viewer () as a portal for querying and visualization of cell- and cluster-level methylation data."

        "We used snmC-seq2[2] to profile genome-wide 5mC at single-cell resolution (Fig. 1a) across the cortex, HIP, striatum and pallidum (or cerebral nuclei, CNU), and olfactory areas (OLF) (Fig. 1b–e) using adult male C57BL/6 mice[16]. In total, we analysed 45 dissected regions in two replicates (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). Fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) of antibody-labelled nuclei was applied to capture NeuN-positive neurons (NeuN+, 92% of neurons), while also sampling a smaller number of NeuN-negative (NeuN–, 8% of neurons) non-neuronal cells (Fig. 1a). In total, we profiled the DNA methylomes of 103,982 single nuclei, yielding, on average, 1.5 million stringently filtered reads per cell (1.50 × 106 ± 0.58 × 106, mean ± s.d.) covering 6.2 ± 2.6% of the cytosines in the mouse genome in each cell. These enabled reliable quantification of the DNA methylation fraction for 25,905 ± 1,090 (95 ± 4%) 100-kb bins and 44,944 ± 4,438 (81 ± 8%) gene bodies (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The global methylation levels range from 0.2% to 7.6% in non-CpG sites and 61.6% to 88.8% in CpG sites (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c).",
        "On the basis of the mCH and mCG profiles in 100-kb bins throughout the genome, we performed a three-level iterative clustering analysis to categorize the epigenomic cell populations (Fig. 1f, g). After quality control and preprocessing (Methods), in the first level (cell class), we clustered 103,982 cells as 67,472 (65%) excitatory neurons, 28,343 (27%) inhibitory neurons, and 8,167 (8%) non-neurons (Supplementary Table 3). The second round of iterative analysis of each cell class identified 41 cell major types in total (cluster size range 95–11,919), and the third round separated these major types further into 161 cell subtypes (cluster size range 12–6,551). All subtypes are highly conserved across replicates, and replicates from the same brain region are co-clustered compared with samples from other brain regions (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g).",
        "The spatial distribution of each cell type is assessed based on where the cells were dissected (Supplementary Table 5). Here we used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)[17] to visualize cell spatial locations (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 3) and major cell types (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Major non-neuronal cell types have a similar distribution across brain regions (Extended Data Fig. 1g), except adult neuron progenitors (ANPs). We found two subtypes of ANPs, presumably corresponding to neuronal precursors in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG)[18] (ANP anp-dg) and the rostral migratory stream[18] in CNU and OLF (ANP anp-olf-cnu). Excitatory neurons from isocortex, OLF and HIP formed different major types, with some exceptions, potentially owing to overlaps in dissected regions (Supplementary Table 2). Cells from the isocortex were further separated on the basis of their projection types[1],[19],[20]. The intratelencephalic (IT) neurons from all cortical regions contain four major types corresponding to the laminar layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6), each of which includes cells from all cortical regions, except L4, which lack cells from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate area (ACA). Excitatory neurons from the HIP were further partitioned into major types corresponding to DG granule cells and different subfields of cornus ammonis (CA). We also identified major types from cortical subplate structures, including the claustrum (CLA) and endopiriform nucleus (EP) from isocortex and OLF dissections. GABAergic inhibitory neurons from isocortex and HIP cluster together into five major types, whereas interneurons from CNU and OLF group into nine major types.",
        "In total, we identified 68 excitatory and 77 inhibitory subtypes (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Table 7). Although there is no one-to-one correspondence between subtypes and brain regions, individual subtypes show differential regional enrichment (Fig. 2a, b, top right) and distinct global mCH levels, ranging from 0.98% (DG dg-all) to 4.64% (PAL-Inh Chat, an inhibitory subtype in pallidum (PAL)) (Fig. 2a, b, bottom right). Specifically, isocortical excitatory subtypes usually consist of cells majorly derived from either the sensorimotor (primary motor (MOp), secondary motor (MOs), primary somatosensory (SSp), and secondary somatosensory (SSs) cortex), medial (PFC and ACA), or frontal areas (orbital (ORB) and agranular insular (AI) area). In the OLF, excitatory cells from the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and main olfactory bulb (MOB) are enriched in the subtype OLF-Exc _Bmpr1b_ , whereas cells from the piriform area (PIR) are relatively enriched in the other OLF-Exc subtypes. Similarly, some inhibitory subtypes in CNU and OLF also correspond to different substructures in these two regions (Supplementary Note 1), indicating substantial spatial-related methylation diversity among CNU and OLF interneurons. By contrast, most caudal (CGE) or medial (MGE) ganglionic eminence-derived inhibitory subtypes contain cells derived predominantly from all cortical or hippocampal regions. To better demonstrate the unprecedented level of neuronal subtype and spatial diversity in their DNA methylomes, we provide a web application to interactively display this information at different granularity (). We also provide a detailed discussion of how exemplified subtypes correspond to cell types with known functional and spatial features (Extended Data Fig. 4) in Supplementary Note 1."

        "Integrating single-cell datasets collected using different molecular profiling modalities can help to establish a consensus cell-type atlas[20],[21]. By integrating the methylome data with the chromatin accessibility data profiled using snATAC-seq on the same brain samples from a parallel study[3], the two modalities validated each other at the subtype level (Fig. 2c, d, Extended Data Fig. 5a–f, Supplementary Table 10). We then calculated overlap scores between the original methylation subtypes (m-types) and the chromatin accessibility subtypes (a-types), which further quantified the matching of subtypes between the two modalities (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 5e, Methods). Moreover, the mCG DMRs (see below) highly overlap with open chromatin peaks in the hippocampal subtypes (Fig. 2f). Their mCG fractions and chromatin accessibility levels show similar cell-type-specificity across hippocampal subtypes, confirming the correct match of cell-type identities (Extended Data Fig. 5f)."

        "To further infer the projection targets of cell subtypes, we integrated our extra-telencephalic (ET) L5 neurons with epi-retro-seq data[22]. Epi-retro-seq uses retrograde viral labelling to select neurons projecting to specific brain regions, followed by methylome analysis of their epigenetic subtypes. Cells from the same brain region of the two datasets are colocalized on _t_ -distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (_t_ -SNE) analysis, validating the subtypes’ spatial distribution (Fig. 2g–i, Extended Data Fig. 5g–i). The overlap scores between unbiased (snmC-seq2) and targeted (epi-retro-seq) profiling experiments (Extended Data Fig. 5j) indicate that some subtypes identified from the same cortical area show different projection specificity. For example, SSp and MOp neurons were mainly enriched in three subtypes marked by _Kcnh1_ , _Tmtc2_ and _Nectin1_ , respectively. However, neurons projecting to the medulla in the MOp and SSp only integrate with the subtype marked with _Kcnh1_ (Fig. 2j), suggesting that the subtypes identified in unbiased methylome profiling have distinct projection specificities."

        "Having developed a consensus map of cell types based on their DNA methylomes, we identified 16,451 differentially CH-methylated genes (CH-DMGs) and 3.9 million CG-differentially methylated regions (CG-DMRs, 624 ± 176 base pairs (bp) mean ± s.d.) between the subtypes (Extended Data Fig. 6, Methods, Supplementary Note 2). snmC-seq2 captures both cell-type-specific gene expression and predicted regulatory events[1],[2]. Specifically, both gene body mCH and mCG negatively correlate with gene expression in neurons, with mCH showing a stronger correlation than mCG[1],[6],[7],[13]. CG-DMRs provide predictions about cell-type-specific regulatory elements and transcription factors whose motifs enriched in these CG-DMRs predict the crucial regulators of the cell type[1],[7],[8].",
        "To further explore the gene regulatory relationship between neuronal subtypes, we constructed taxonomy trees for excitatory and inhibitory subtypes, based on gene body mCH of CH-DMGs (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b, Methods). The dendrogram structures represent the similarities between these discrete subtypes and may reflect the developmental history of neuronal type specification[19],[23]. Next, we used both CH-DMGs and CG-DMRs to annotate the tree and explore the features specifying cell subtypes (excitatory in Fig. 3a–c and inhibitory in Extended Data Fig. 7c, d). Specifically, we calculated a branch-specific methylation impact score for each gene or transcription factor motif that summarizes all of the pairwise comparisons related to that branch (Extended Data Fig. 7e; Methods). The impact score ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher score predicting stronger functional relevance to the branch. We assign 6,038 unique genes to branches within the excitatory taxonomy (5,975 in inhibitory taxonomy), including 406 transcription factor genes (412 in inhibitory taxonomy) using genes with impact scores greater than 0.3. For example, motifs from the ROR (also known as NR1F) family were assigned to the branch that separates superficial layer IT neurons from deeper layer IT neurons (Fig. 3d–f, node 9), whereas motifs from the CUX family were assigned to the IT-L2/3 branch, separating it from IT-L4/5 neurons (Fig. 3d–f, node 11). Both of these families contain members, such as _Cux1_ , _Cux2_ and _Rorb_ , that show laminar expression in the corresponding layers and regulate cortical layer differentiation during development[19].",
        "After impact score assignment, each branch of this taxonomy was associated with multiple transcription factor genes and motifs, which potentially function in combination to shape cell-type identities[24] (Fig. 3e, f). For example, we focused on two brain structures of interest: the CLA and the EP[25],[26]. At the major-cell-type level, distinct clusters are marked by _Npsr1_ (EP) and _B3gat2_ (CLA). The known EP and CLA marker transcription factor _Nr4a2_[25] also shows hypomethylation in both clusters compared to other clusters. Accordingly, the NR4A2 motif is also associated with a branch that splits CLA neurons from IT-L6 neurons (Fig. 3d–f, node 6). On another branch separating EP from CLA and IT-L6 neurons, genes for several transcription factors, including NF-1 family members _Nfia_ and _Nfib_ and the RFX family member _Rfx3_ , together with corresponding motifs (Fig. 3d–f, node 5) rank near the top. Our findings suggest that these transcription factors may function together with _Nr4a2_ , potentially separating EP neurons from CLA and IT-L6 neurons.",
        "Beyond identifying specific cell-subtype characteristics, we derived total impact (TI) scores to summarize the methylation variation of genes and motifs to understand their relative importance in cell type diversification and function (Extended Data Fig. 7f–k, Supplementary Note 3). By comparing the TI scores of genes and motifs calculated from the inhibitory and excitatory taxonomies, we found that there were more transcription factor genes and motifs having large TI scores in both cell classes than in either one or the other (Extended Data Fig. 7f, i). For instance, _Bcl11b_ distinguishes OLF-Exc and IT neurons in the excitatory lineage and distinguishes CGE-_Lamp5_ and CGE-_Vip_ in the inhibitory lineage. Similarly, _Satb1_ separates IT–L4 from IT-L2/3 and MGE from CGE in excitatory and inhibitory cells. These findings indicate broad repurposing of transcription factors for cell-type specification among distinct developmental lineages."

        "To systematically identify enhancer-like regions in specific cell types, we predicted enhancer-DMRs (eDMR) by integrating matched DNA methylome and chromatin accessibility profiles[3] of 161 subtypes (Fig. 4a, Methods). We identified 1,612,198 eDMR (34% of CG-DMRs), 73% of which overlapped with separately identified snATAC-seq peaks (Fig. 4b). Fetal-enhancer DMRs (feDMR) (that is, eDMRs between development time points) of forebrain bulk tissues[8] show high (88%) overlap with eDMRs. Surprisingly, the eDMRs also cover 74% of the feDMRs from other fetal tissues[8], indicating extensive reuse of enhancer-like regulatory elements across mammalian tissue types (Fig. 4b).",
        "Next, we examined the relationship between the cell-type-signature genes and their potential regulatory elements. We calculated the partial correlation between all DMG–DMR pairs within 1 Mb distance using methylation levels across 145 neuronal subtypes (Methods). We identified a total of 1,038,853 (64%) eDMRs that correlated with at least one gene (correlation >0.3 with empirical _P_ <0.005, two-sided permutation test, Extended Data Fig. 8a). Notably, for those strongly positive-correlated DMR–DMG pairs (correlation >0.5), the DMRs are largely (63%) within 100 kb of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the corresponding genes but are depleted from ±1 kb (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 8b), whereas for the negatively correlated DMR–DMG pairs, only 11% of DMRs are found within 100 kb of the TSS (Extended Data Fig. 8c).",
        "Using the gene–enhancer interactions predicted by this correlation analysis, we assigned eDMRs to their target genes. The percentages of feDMR-overlapping eDMRs vary markedly among genes (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 8d, e). Of note, DMRs assigned to the same gene show different mCG specificity among subtypes. For example, _Tle4_ -correlated eDMR could be partitioned into three groups (Extended Data Fig. 8e–g). One group (G2) of elements that displayed little diversity in bulk data showed highly specific mCG and open-chromatin signals in MSN–D1/D2 neurons, whereas another group (G3) was specific to CT–L6 neurons. These two groups of DMRs suggest that possible alternative regulatory elements are used to regulate the same gene in different cell types, although further experiments are required to validate this hypothesis.",
        "Together, these analyses allow us to carefully chart the specificity of regulatory elements identified in bulk tissues to the subtype level. Besides, we identified many regulatory elements that show more restricted specificity (for example, eDMRs correlated with _Tle4_ in MSN-D1/D2), providing abundant candidates for further pursuing enhancer-driven adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that target highly specific cell types[27]."

Therefore, to examine whether physical chromatin contacts support our correlation-based predictions of enhancer–gene associations, we generated sn-m3C-seq[4] data for 5,142 single nuclei from the HIP (152,000 contacts per cell on average). We assigned these cells, on the basis of the sn-m3C-seq data, to eight major cell types based on integration with the snmC-seq2 HIP data. In total, 19,151 chromosome loops were identified in at least one of the cell types at 25-kb resolution (range from 1,173 to 12,614 chromosome loops per cell type).",
        "Using DG and CA1 as examples, a notably higher correlation was observed between enhancers and genes at loop anchors than between random enhancer–gene pairs (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Reciprocally, the enhancer–gene pairs showing stronger correlation with methylation were more likely to be found linked by chromosome loops or within the same looping region (Extended Data Fig. 8i). We also compared the concordance of methylation patterns between genes and enhancers linked by different methods and found the pairs linked by loop anchors or closest genes had the highest correlation of methylation (Extended Data Fig. 8j). Together, these analyses validate the physical proximity of enhancer–gene pairs predicted by our correlation-based method in specific cell types.",
        "Additionally, we observed significant cell-type-specific 3D genome structures. The major cell types could be distinguished on UMAP embedding on the basis of chromosome interaction (Fig. 4e), indicating the dynamic nature of genome architecture across cell types. Among the 19,151 chromosome loops, 48.7% showed significantly different contact frequency between cell types (Fig. 4f). eDMRs were highly enriched at these differential loop anchors (Extended Data Fig. 8k). mCG levels at distal _cis_ -elements are typically anti-correlated with enhancer activity[8]. Thus, we hypothesized that enhancers at differential loop anchors might also be hypomethylated in the corresponding cell type. Indeed, using the loops identified in DG and CA1 as examples, we observed that enhancers at the anchor of cell-type-specific loops show corresponding hypomethylation in the same cell type that the loop is specific to (Extended Data Fig. 8l).",
        "Many differential loops were observed near marker genes of the corresponding cell type. For example, _Foxp1_ , a gene for a CA1-specific transcription factor[29], has chromosome loops surrounding its gene body in CA1 but not DG (Fig. 4g, h). eDMRs and open chromatin were observed at these loop anchors. Notably, three loops in CA1 anchored at the TSS of the same transcript of _Foxp1_ (Fig. 4h). Stronger demethylation and chromatin accessibility were also observed at the same transcript than in other transcripts (Fig. 4h, box E). These epigenetic patterns might suggest a specific transcript of _Foxp1_ (Foxp1-225) is selectively activated in CA1. by contrast, _Lrrtm4_ , encoding a DG specific presynaptic protein that mediates excitatory synapse development[30], shows extensive looping to distal elements in DG but not CA1 (Extended Data Fig. 8n). Notably, among 34 genes showing alternative loop usage, 20 genes expressed in both DG and CA1[31]; for example, the TSS of _Grm7_ interacts with an upstream enhancer in DG and gene body enhancers in CA1 (Extended Data Fig. 8o)."

In agreement with the anti-correlation between transcript levels and DNA methylation, we found hypomethylation in IT neurons of the layer marker genes[19] (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Furthermore, UMAP embedding (Fig. 5a) reveals a continuous gradient of IT neurons resembling the medial–lateral distribution of the cortical regions (Fig. 5b), strongly suggesting that the arealization information is well preserved in the DNA methylome.",
        "To systematically explore the spatial gradient of DNA methylation, we merged the cells into spatial groups on the basis of their cortical layer and region and generated a taxonomy between them (Methods). The taxonomy split the cells into four layer groups, followed by cortical-region separation within each layer (Extended Data Fig. 9c), providing a clear structure for investigating layer-related or region-related methylation variation. Specifically, the layer-related transcription factors included many known laminar marker genes and their DNA-binding motifs (Extended Data Fig. 9d), whereas some also show regional specific methylation differences. For example, _Cux1_ , encoding a homeobox transcription factor specific to L2/3 and L4 neurons, is hypomethylated in motor (MO) and somatosensory (SS) cortex, but is hypermethylated in L2/3 of other regions, in agreement with patterns from in situ hybridization[32]. _Cux2_ , which encodes another homeobox transcription factor, does not show the same regional specificity (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We also identified genes for many additional transcription factors that showed cortical region specificity (Fig. 5c, Extended Data Fig. 9e). For example, _Etv6_ is only hypomethylated in medial dissection regions across layers, whereas _Zic4_ is hypermethylated in those regions. By contrast, _Rora_ shows an anterior–posterior methylation gradient within the L4 and L5 cells. Together, these observed methylome spatial gradients demonstrated the value of our dataset for further exploring the cortical arealization with cell-type resolution."

This gradient correlated with the anterior–posterior position of brain sections. Granule cells from the most posterior DG regions had higher global methylation than cells from anterior regions (Fig. 5d).",

We reasoned that DG granule cells, which are continuously replenished by ongoing neurogenesis throughout the lifespan, may accumulate mCH during their post-mitotic maturation. If so, global mCH should correlate with the age and maturity of granule cells. To investigate this, we divided DG granule cells into four groups on the basis of their global mCH levels and investigated regions of differential methylation between the groups. We identified 219,498 gradient CG-DMRs between the four groups, among which 139,387 showed a positive correlation with global mCH (+DMR), and 80,111 were negatively correlated (−DMR) (Fig. 5e). Notably, genes overlapping +DMRs or −DMRs have different annotated functions: genes enriched in +DMRs (+DMRgenes, _n_ = 328) were associated with developmental processes, whereas those enriched in −DMRs (−DMRgenes, _n_ = 112) were related to synaptic function (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b).",
        "To further test the relationship between the +DMRgenes, −DMRgenes and DG development, we examined the expression patterns of these genes across time using a single-cell RNA-seq dataset that grouped DG cells into eight cell types, along their developmental trajectory from radial glia to mature granule cells[33]. The +DMRgenes were more highly expressed in immature cell types than in mature cell types (for example, _Tcf4_ ; Fig. 5f, Extended Data Fig. 10c), whereas the −DMRgenes showed the reverse trend (for example, _Rfx3_ ; Fig. 5g, Extended Data Fig. 10d). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that young DG granule cells have low global mCH and low methylation at genes associated with neural precursors. Conversely, older DG granule cells accumulate greater global mCH and have low methylation at genes associated with mature neurons. Notably, the global mCH levels also correlate with the brain dissections (Fig. 5d), indicating that the spatial axis can partially explain the methylation gradient (Supplementary Note 4).",
        "Next, we investigated whether the global methylation level is correlated with 3D genome architecture. By plotting the chromatin interaction strength against the anchors’ genomic distance, we observed a higher proportion of short-range contacts and a smaller proportion of long-range contacts in the groups with higher global mCH (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Although compartment strengths were not correlated with the global methylation changes (Extended Data Fig. 10g), the number of intra-domain contacts was positively correlated with global mCH across single cells (Extended Data Fig. 10h). After normalizing for the effect of decay, we found that insulation scores at domain boundaries were significantly lower in the groups with high global mCH levels (Extended Data Fig. 10i; all _P_ < 1 × 10−10, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Together these suggest that local structures may be more condensed over flanking regions in the high-mCH cell groups."

        "To further quantify the spatial and cell-type information encoded in a single cell’s DNA methylome, we built a multi-task deep ANN using cell-level methylome profiles from this study (Fig. 6a). Specifically, mCH levels of 100-kb bins were used to train and test the network with fivefold cross-validation (Method). The ANN predicted neuronal subtype identity and spatial location simultaneously for each testing cell with 95% and 89% accuracy, respectively (Fig. 6b–d). Notably, the location prediction accuracy of the ANN was higher than using only the spatial distribution information of subtypes (overall increased by 38%, Extended Data Fig. 11c), suggesting that spatial diversity is well-preserved in the neuronal DNA methylome. We also notice higher levels of errors in location prediction of some cell types, especially in the cortical MGE and CGE inhibitory neurons (Fig. 6c, Extended Data Fig. 11c). This finding is consistent with previous transcriptome-based studies[19],[31], suggesting these neurons do not display strong cortical region specificity. Many cell-type marker genes are also enriched in features that capture most spatial information (Fig. 6e, f). For example, besides distinguishing CT-L6 neurons from other cell types, _Foxp2_ shows notable mCH differences among dissected regions within CT-L6 (Fig. 6f). Notably, we also observed the moderate spatial specificity of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes using a separate model trained with methylomes of non-neuronal cells (Supplementary Note 5)."

        "In this Article, we present a single-cell DNA methylomic atlas of the mouse brain with detailed spatial dissection. This comprehensive dataset enables high-throughput cell-type classification, marker gene prediction and identification of regulatory elements. The three-level iterative clustering defined 161 subtypes representing excitatory (68), inhibitory (77) and non-neuronal cells (16). The development of a hierarchical taxonomic architecture for cell subtypes on the basis of CH-DMGs allowed us to assign specific genes and transcription factor binding motifs to taxonomy branches using the methylation impact score. These assignments describe cell-type specificity at different levels, potentially relating to different developmental stages of each neuronal lineage. Notably, we found that transcription factor genes and their corresponding DNA-binding motifs were co-associated with the same branch in the taxonomy, providing a rich source of candidate transcription factors for future study.",
        "Through integration with snATAC-seq[3], we matched subtypes classified in both epigenomic modalities and used the combined information to predict 1.6 million active-enhancer-like eDMRs, including 72% of cell-type-specific elements missed from previous tissue-level bulk studies[8]. To examine the associations of eDMRs and their targeting genes, we applied multi-omic methods to establish an eDMR–gene landscape using correlation-based prediction and chromatin conformation profiling using sn-m3C-seq, resulting in the identification of chromatin loops between eDMRs and their potential targeting genes in specific cell types.",
        "Our brain-wide epigenomic dataset reveals extraordinary spatial diversity encoded in the DNA methylomes of neurons. The ANN trained on the single-cell methylome profiles accurately reproduced the detailed brain-dissection information within most subtypes, indicating the existence of large spatial methylation gradients throughout the brain. Echoing cortex development studies[34], glutamatergic neurons are regionalized by a protomap formed from an early developmental gradient of transcription factor expression. Similarly, we observed that many transcription factor genes and their corresponding DNA-binding motifs showed gradients of DNA methylation in adult IT neurons from distinct cortical regions. Additionally, we also found intra-subtype methylation gradients in DG granule cells that correlate with the spatial axis in the DG. These gradient-related CG-DMRs are enriched in essential neurodevelopmental and synaptic genes[33],[35], suggesting that these spatially resolved DNA methylation gradients reflect past regulatory events occurring during brain maturation. We qualify our findings by noting that snmC-seq2 is a sodium bisulfite-based method and cannot distinguish between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which has been shown to accumulate in some brain regions[36]. New methods will be needed to simultaneously measure the full complement of cytosine base modifications at the single-cell level.",
        "Overall, our analysis highlights the power of this dataset power for characterizing cell types using gene activity information from both coding regions and the regulatory elements in the non-coding regions of the genome. This comprehensive epigenomic dataset provides a valuable resource for answering fundamental questions about gene regulation in specifying cell-type spatial diversity and provides the raw material to develop new genetic tools for targeting specific cell types and functional testing."

The base calls of each pair of CpG sites were added before analysis. In brief, the methylpy function used a permutation-based root mean square test of goodness of fit to identify differentially methylated sites (DMS) simultaneously across all samples (subtypes in this case), and then merge the DMS within 250 bp into the DMR. We further excluded DMS calls that have low absolute mCG level differences by using a robust-mean-based approach. For each DMR merged from the DMS, we ordered all the samples by their mCG fraction and calculated the robust mean _m_ using the samples between 25th and 75th percentiles. We then reassigned hypo-DMR and hyper-DMR to each sample when a region met two criteria: (1) the sample mCG fraction of this DMR is lower than (_m_ − 0.3) for hypo-DMR or (_m_ + 0.3) for hyper-DMR, and (2) the DMR is originally a significant hypo- or hyper-DMR in that sample judged by methylpy.

The shared layer is further connected simultaneously to two branch hidden layers of the subsection region’s subtype, each containing 200 nodes. The corresponding one-hot encoding output layers follow branch hidden layers. We used fivefold cross-validation to access the model performance. We applied the dropout technique[64] with a dropout rate _P_ = 0.5 on each hidden layer to prevent overfitting during the training. Adam optimization[65] was used to train the network with a cross-entropy loss function. The training epoch number and batch size are 10 and 100, respectively.

When calculating the cell dissection region accuracy (Fig. 6c), we defined two kinds of accuracy with different stringency: (1) the exact accuracy using the predicted label, and (2) the fuzzy accuracy using predicted labels or its potential overlap neighbours. The potential overlap neighbours curated based on Allen CCF (Extended Data Fig. 11a, Supplementary Table 2) stood for adjacent regions of a particular dissection region. The exact accuracy of the ANN model is 69% and the fuzzy accuracy is 89%. To evaluate how much of the dissection region accuracy was improved via ANN, we calculated fuzzy accuracy based only on naive guesses in each subtype based on the dissection region composition (grey dots in Extended Data Fig. 11c). We also trained additional models using logistic regression and random forest for benchmarks. The performance of ANN on subtype prediction is comparable with logistic regression and random forest. By contrast, the performance in location prediction is substantially improved against the other two models (Extended Data Fig. 11b), suggesting that distinguishing the cells from different dissected regions may require nonlinear relationships between genomic regions.
