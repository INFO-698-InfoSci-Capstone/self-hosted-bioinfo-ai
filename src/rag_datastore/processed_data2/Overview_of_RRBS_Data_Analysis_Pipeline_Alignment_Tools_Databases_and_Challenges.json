        "The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies now provides opportunities to interrogate DNA methylation at single base resolution with high coverage on a massive scale. Bisulfite sequencing is the gold-standard for measuring methylation over the genomes of interest (Wreczycka et al., 2017). The [reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) ](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html)has been widely used for studying genome-wide DNA methylation due to its significantly reduced sequencing cost and high-sequencing coverage and sensitivity (Gu et al., 2010; Meissner et al., 2005).",
        "[RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) is a standardized method extensively employed for DNA methylation analysis, which precisely delineates the methylation patterns in genomes by leveraging sequencing technology in combination with bioinformatic analysis. This method offers the merit of a high-resolution analysis at a single-base level, thus facilitating a precise evaluation of the methylation status of each cytosine base, with a notable cost-efficiency. The application of[ RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) spans a broad spectrum in biology and medical research. It has been extensively appropriated for studying various subjects such as disease risk factors, genetic traits, biomarkers discovery, tumourigenesis, mental disorders, metabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, as well as enhancements in plant and animal breeding programmes and reproductive research.",

        "[RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) serves as a potent method to explore genome-wide methylation patterns and aids researchers in mapping methylation landscapes across various genomic regions encompassing promoters, intergenic areas, introns, and transcription termination sites. Such investigations unravel the functional role of DNA methylation in the orchestration of gene regulation and the broader context of epigenetic inheritance. By juxtaposing the methylation levels across diverse samples, one can identify differentially methylated sites - genomic positions demonstrating notable variations in their methylation statuses under distinct physiological states, disease conditions, or environmental circumstances. These findings play a significant role in deciphering disease pathogenesis, identifying potential biomarkers, and understanding the impact of environmental factors on genome methylation.",
        "[RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) is often utilized in cancer research. By contrasting methylation differences between cancerous samples and their normal counterparts, RRBS can facilitate the discovery of methylation markers pertinent to the onset and progression of cancer. This approach is crucial for early cancer detection, therapeutic target identification, and the elucidation of tumor development mechanisms. Furthermore, RRBS data can also contribute significantly to epigenetic research, including the analysis of tissue-specific methylation patterns, examination of inter-individual methylation genetic variations, and investigations into the impact of environmental factors on genomic methylation.",
        "RRBS has been prominently deployed in agriculture to study crop development, adaptability, and agronomic traits. By comparing methylation patterns across various crop varieties, particular methylation markers associated with essential agronomic characteristics such as yield, quality, and resilience can be unveiled. These insights assist in the selection of superior varieties and targeted genetic enhancement, providing a means to increase both yield and environmental tolerance. [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) bolsters research into the dynamic changes in DNA methylation throughout crop growth and development. An analysis of methylation patterns at different stages of growth or within distinct organs can decipher the role of genomic methylation in orchestrating growth processes, revealing methylation sites and networks related to growth regulation.",
        "Furthermore, [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) data can be paired with [RNA sequencing](https://www.cd-genomics.com/rna-seq-transcriptome.html) data to perform correlational analyses between methylation and gene expression. By bridging methylation sites with gene expression levels, the regulatory role of methylation in gene expression can be unveiled, and regulatory networks pertinent to specific biological processes or diseases can be identified."

Pipeline for analysis of RRBS data. CpG: CG sequences, C is cytosine and G is guanine. CHG and CHH: H is A (adenine), C or T (thymine).",
        "The analysis of [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) data typically encompasses the following steps:",
        "**Quality Control:** Quality control is the first step in data analysis, ensuring high data quality and reliability. This step typically employs tools like FastQC to evaluate the quality of raw sequencing data. These tools examine metrics such as base quality distribution, GC content, sequence length distribution, and over-representation to identify contamination, low-quality sequences, or other issues, allowing appropriate filtering and trimming measures to be taken.",
        "**Alignment to Reference Genome:** Once through quality control, filtered sequencing data is aligned to a reference genome. In [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) data analysis, due to the method targeting specific DNA fragments, the alignment process must consider the specificity of enzyme cleavage sites. Common alignment tools include Bismark, BSseeker2, etc. Alignment results are typically saved in SAM or BAM format for subsequent identification and analysis of methylated sites.",
        "**Identification of Methylated Sites:** Following alignment of the data, the imperative arises to identify methylated sites. This pivotal step typically unfolds across two phases: alignment-based identification and proportion-based identification. The former hinges on discerning methylated sites by contrasting methylated sequences with the reference genome. Conversely, the latter approach involves estimating methylation levels at each site through statistical analysis.",
        "**Estimation of Methylation Levels:** Once methylated sites have been identified, the subsequent task entails quantifying their methylation levels. Typically, this involves estimating methylation levels by computing the ratio of methylated fragments to unmethylated fragments within sequencing data. These ratios are commonly denoted as Beta values (β values) or Methylation Ratios. Through such estimation, insights into the degree of methylation at various genomic loci can be garnered, thereby enhancing our understanding of epigenetic modifications.",
        "![Figure 2. MD plot showing the log-fold-change of the methylation level and average abundance of each CpG site.](https://www.cd-genomics.com/wp-content/themes/v1/images/figure2-overview-of-rrbs-data-analysis-pipeline-alignment-tools-databases-and-challenges.jpg)Figure 2. MD plot showing the log-fold-change of the methylation level and average abundance of each CpG site. (Chen et al., 2017)",
        "**Differential Methylation Analysis:** Following methylation level estimation, differential methylation analysis compares methylation levels between different samples to identify differentially methylated sites. This analysis commonly employs statistical methods (e.g., limma, edgeR, DMRcate) to test for significant differences in methylation levels and determine differentially methylated sites based on predetermined thresholds.",
        "**Functional Annotation:** Functional annotation of differentially methylated sites aids in understanding their genomic distribution and biological functions. This step typically involves utilizing genomic annotation information such as gene structures, promoter regions, enhancers, etc. Associating differentially methylated sites with biological functions further explores the biological significance of methylation.",
        "**Pathway Analysis:** Following differential methylation analysis, pathway analysis is often performed on differentially methylated genes to understand their functional pathways and interaction networks in biological processes. Pathway analysis typically utilizes bioinformatics databases and tools (e.g., DAVID, Enrichr, GSEA) to identify biological pathways and functional modules associated with differentially methylated genes."

        "Because of the complexity of bisulfite sequencing alignments (the aligned sequences do not exactly match the reference genome, and the complexity of the libraries is reduced), standard sequence alignment software cannot be used. Due to the unique properties of [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html), special tools are needed for alignment and analysis. Five commonly used mapping algorithms for benchmarking analysis in RRBS data, include Bismark, BS-Seeker2, BSMAP, GSNAP, and bwa-meth, which are listed in Table 1 (Sun et al., 2018).",

The installation and configuration of BSseeker2 might necessitate some extra labor as compared to other tools. Notwithstanding, it proves competent in matching RRBS sequencing data, recognizing methylation sites, and performing differential methylation analyses.",
        "BSMAP, albeit simple and handy to utilize with a straightforward installation and configuration process, primarily excels with small-scale[ RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) data due to its high accuracy. However, it may not be as efficacious as other algorithms in response to complex methylation patterns.",
        "GSNAP is versatile, serving not only for aligning DNA sequencing data but also RNA sequencing data, among other applications. It demonstrates robust performance in handling complex genomic datasets, exhibiting high alignment accuracy. However, its drawback lies in potentially slower processing of large-scale RRBS data and the relatively complex configuration and usage.",

MethylDackel finds utility in rapidly processing modest-sized [RRBS ](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html)data and conducting preliminary methylation site identification.",
        "Trim Galore typically functions as a preprocessing tool, dedicated to quality control and filtering [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) data. It automatically detects and trims low-quality sequences within sequencing data, enhancing data quality. However, Trim Galore itself does not perform alignment or methylation site identification and necessitates integration with other tools for comprehensive analysis."

      "paragraphs": [
        "There are two key factors affecting the accuracy of methylation calls when determining the methylation state of bisulfite sequencing reads. First, the sequencing reads must be correct and derive entirely from bisulfite-converted sequences. Second, the reads must be correctly mapped to the reference genome. Failure of these two factors will result in the generation of incorrect methylation calls. And in extreme cases, the noise from these miscalls can adversely affect the conclusions of the experiment (Krueger et al., 2012). The process of restriction enzymes (commonly using restriction endonuclease MspI) digestion, bisulfite conversion and sequencing involved in [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) would affect these two factors.",

Quite a few MspI digested fragments, even shorter than 40bp, will be generated during the process. If the size selection process is not as good as it is in theory, often a sizeable number of fragments below 40bp can end up in the [RRBS](https://www.cd-genomics.com/reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing.html) library.",
