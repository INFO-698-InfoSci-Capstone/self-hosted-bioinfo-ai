        "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a genomic approach for the detection and quantitative analysis of messenger RNA molecules in a biological sample and is useful for studying cellular responses. RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology—the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation."

        "Medicine now exists in a cellular and molecular era, where experimental biologists and clinicians seek to understand and modify cell behaviour through targeted molecular approaches. To generate a molecular understanding of cells, the cells can be assessed in a variety of ways, for example through analyses of genomic DNA sequences, chromatin structure, messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences, non-protein-coding RNA, protein expression, protein modifications and metabolites. Given that the absolute quantity of any of these molecules is very small in a single living cell, for practical reasons many of these molecules have been assessed in ensembles of thousands to billions of cells. This approach has yielded much useful molecular information, for example in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), where genomic DNA assessments have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomes of individual humans that have been associated with particular biological traits and disease susceptibilities.",
        "To understand cellular responses, assessments of gene expression or protein expression are needed. For protein expression studies, the application of multi-colour flow cytometry and fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies has made the simultaneous assessment of small numbers of proteins on vast numbers of single cells commonplace in experimental and clinical research. More recently, mass cytometry (Box 1), which involves cell staining with antibodies labelled with heavy metal ions and quantitative measurements using time-of-flight detectors, has increased the number of proteins that can be assessed by five- to tenfold [[1](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR1 \"Newell EW, Sigal N, Bendall SC, Nolan GP, Davis MM.

However, it remains challenging to examine simultaneously the entire complement of the thousands of proteins (known as the ‘proteome’) expressed by the genome that exist in a single cell.",
        "As a proxy for studying the proteome, many researchers have turned to protein-encoding, mRNA molecules (collectively termed the ‘transcriptome’), whose expression correlates well with cellular traits and changes in cellular state. Transcriptomics was initially conducted on ensembles of millions of cells, firstly with hybridization-based microarrays, and later with next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques referred to as RNA-seq. RNA-seq on pooled cells has yielded a vast amount of information that continues to fuel discovery and innovation in biomedicine. Taking just one clinically relevant example—RNA-seq was recently performed on haematopoietic stem cells to stratify acute myeloid leukaemia patients into cohorts requiring differing treatment regimens [[4](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR4 \"Ng SW, Mitchell A, Kennedy JA, Chen WC, McLeod J, Ibrahimova N, et al. A 17-gene stemness score for rapid determination of risk in acute leukaemia. Nature. 2016;540:433–7.\")]. Nevertheless, the averaging that occurs in pooling large numbers of cells does not allow detailed assessment of the fundamental biological unit—the cell—or the individual nuclei that package the genome.",
        "Since the first scRNA-seq study was published in 2009 [[5](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR5 \"Tang F, Barbacioru C, Wang Y, Nordman E, Lee C, Xu N, et al. mRNA-seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell.

Next, isolated individual cells are lysed to allow capture of as many RNA molecules as possible.

Next, poly[T]-primed mRNA is converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) by a reverse transcriptase. Depending on the scRNA-seq protocol, the reverse-transcription primers will also have other nucleotide sequences added to them, such as adaptor sequences for detection on NGS platforms, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs; Box 1) to mark unequivocally a single mRNA molecule, as well as sequences to preserve information on cellular origin [[41](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR41 \"Kivioja T, Vähärautio A, Karlsson K, Bonke M, Enge M, Linnarsson S, et al.

Furthermore, commercial reagents also exist for preparing barcoded cDNA libraries, for example Illumina’s Nextera kits. Once single cells have been deposited into individual wells of a plate, these protocols, and others from additional commercial suppliers (for example, BD Life Sciences/Cellular Research), can be conducted without the need for further expensive hardware other than accurate multi-channel pipettes, although it should be noted that, in the absence of a microfluidic platform in which to perform scRNA-seq reactions (for example, the C1 platform from Fluidigm), reaction volumes and therefore reagent costs can increase substantially.

This will provide a highly valuable reference for future basic research and translational studies.",
        "Although there is great confidence in the general utility of scRNA-seq, one technical barrier must be carefully considered—the effective isolation of single cells from the tissue of interest. While this has been relatively straightforward for immune cells in peripheral blood or loosely retained in secondary lymphoid tissue, and certainly has been achievable for excised tumours, this could be quite different for many other tissues, in which single cells can be cemented to extracellular-scaffold-like structures and to other neighbouring cells. Although commercial reagents exist for releasing cells from such collagen-based tethers (for example, MACS Tissue Dissociation kits from Miltenyi Biotec), there remains significant theoretical potential for these protocols to alter mRNA levels before single-cell capture, lysis and poly[T] priming. In addition, although communication between neighbouring cells can serve to maintain cellular states, scRNA-seq operates under the assumption that isolation of single cells away from such influences does not trigger rapid artefactual transcriptomic changes before mRNA capture. Thus, before embarking on a scRNA-seq study, researchers should aim to optimize the recovery of single cells from their target tissue, without excessive alteration to the transcriptome. It should also be noted that emerging studies have performed scRNA-seq on nuclei rather than intact single cells, which requires less tissue dissociation, and where nuclei were isolated in a manner that was less biased by cell type than single-cell dissociation [[34](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR34 \"Habib N, Li Y, Heidenreich M, Swiech L, Avraham-Davidi I, Trombetta JJ, et al.

        "With regard to preserving single-cell transcriptomes before scRNA-seq, most published scRNA-seq studies progressed immediately from single-cell isolation to cell lysis and mRNA capture. This is clearly an important consideration for experimental design as it is not trivial to process multiple samples simultaneously from biological replicate animals or individual patients if labour-intensive single-cell isolation protocols such as FACS-sorting or micro-dissection are employed. Commercial droplet-based platforms might offer a partial solution as a small number of samples (for example, eight samples on the Chromium system) can be processed simultaneously. For samples derived from different individuals, SNP information might allow processing as pools, followed by haplotype-based deconvolution of cells [[52](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR52 \"Kang HM, Subramaniam M, Targ S, Nguyen M, Maliskova L, Wan E, et al.

We emphasize, however, that almost all published scRNA-seq protocols have been excellent at determining the relative abundance of moderately to highly expressed transcripts within one cell. In some cases, including for splice-variant analysis, full-length transcript information is required, meaning that the 3’-end counting protocols would be discounted. In other applications, such as identification of cell types from complex tissues, maximising the throughput of cells is key. In such cases, the droplet-based methods hold an advantage, having relatively low cost per cell, which has an accompanying trade-off in reduced sensitivity.",

First, one has to carefully calibrate the concentration that results in an optimal fraction of reads from the spike-ins. Second, spike-in mixes are sensitive to degradation, which can manifest as batch differences across temporally separated samples. Finally, spike-ins have been shown to be captured less efficiently than endogenous transcripts [[33](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR33 \"Svensson V, Natarajan KN, Ly LH, Miragaia RJ, Labalette C, Macaulay IC, et al.

        "Two important questions that researchers face are ‘how many cells must I analyse?’ and the seemingly unrelated question ‘to what depth must my sequencing analysis be performed?’ The answers to these questions are in fact intertwined. Given that most scRNA-seq data are generated by sequencing cDNA libraries from single cells that are barcoded and pooled, the depth of single-cell sequencing (that is, the number of transcripts detected from each cell) diminishes as the number of libraries included in a sequencing run is increased, owing to a finite sequencing capacity per run.",
        "As a rule of thumb, the required number of cells increases with the complexity of the sample under investigation. In a heterogeneous population of cells, for example T lymphocytes that express highly diverse antigen receptors, it might be difficult to observe relationships between transcriptomes, and, in such instances, a larger number of cells will provide greater statistical power and opportunity to observe patterns. In some cases, heterogeneity can be reduced by experimental design. For example, in recent studies of murine T-cell responses in vivo, this issue was circumvented by employing transgenic T-cell receptor cells that expressed the same antigen receptor [[24](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR24 \"Lonnberg T, Svensson V, James KR, Fernandez-Ruiz D, Sebina I, Montandon R, et al.

Indeed, increasing the cell numbers to be assessed, yet keeping the read depth relatively low, provides increasing power at detecting populations that exist at a frequency of < 1% of the total population. Therefore, opting for a lower read depth is practical and economical if the goal of the study is to identify rare cell populations or to scan cells for evidence of mixed populations. However, lower read depths will not necessarily provide detailed information on gene expression within any given single cell, and many biological processes associated with more-subtle transcriptional signatures necessitate deeper sequencing. It is at this point that the ‘ _zero_ or _dropout_ problem’ (Box 1) of scRNA-seq should be raised. The efficiency with which poly-adenylated mRNA species are captured, converted into cDNA and amplified is currently unclear, and, depending on the study, can range between 10 and 40% [[13](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR13 \"Shalek AK, Satija R, Shuga J, Trombetta JJ, Gennert D, Lu D, et al.

This means that, even if a gene is being expressed, perhaps at a low level, there is a certain probability that it will not be detected by current scRNA-seq methods. A partial solution to this issue is to increase read depth. However, beyond a certain point, this strategy leads to diminishing returns as the fraction of PCR duplicates increases with deeper sequencing. Current data suggest that single-cell libraries from all common protocols are very close to saturation when sequenced to a depth of 1,000,000 reads, and a large majority of genes are detected already with 500,000 reads, although the exact relationships are protocol specific [[32](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR32 \"Ziegenhain C, Vieth B, Parekh S, Reinius B, Guillaumet-Adkins A, Smets M, et al.

        "However, the confidence in whether a gene is truly expressed, or not, depends on how many mRNA molecules are detectable, which is dependent on many factors, including mRNA stability. The data suggest that, if the main goal of the study is to characterize the transcriptome of a particular cell with the greatest possible resolution, then a median read depth of around one million is essential. It should be noted that researchers can also employ lower read-depth datasets to explore on a population level whether a given gene appears to be expressed within cell populations. Thus, gene-specific information can be extracted from lower read-depth datasets. However, more-detailed examination of gene–gene co-expression and co-regulation or differential gene splicing requires high read depths.",

      "paragraphs": [
        "While scRNA-seq workflows are conceptually closely related to population-level transcriptomics protocols, data from scRNA-seq experiments have several features that require specific bioinformatics approaches. First, even with the most sensitive platforms, the data are relatively sparse owing to a high frequency of dropout events (lack of detection of specific transcripts). Moreover, owing to the digital nature of gene expression at the single-cell level, and the related phenomenon of transcriptional bursting (in which pulses of transcriptional activity are followed by inactive refractory periods; Box 1), transcript levels are subject to temporal fluctuation, further contributing to the high frequency of zero observations in scRNA-seq data. Therefore, the numbers of expressed genes detected from single cells are typically lower compared with population-level ensemble measurements. Because of this imperfect coverage, the commonly used unit of normalized transcript levels used for bulk RNA-seq, expressed as ‘reads per kilobase per million’ (RPKM), is biased on a single-cell level, and instead the related unit ‘transcripts per million’ (TPM) should be used for scRNA-seq [[66](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR66 \"Wagner GP, Kin K, Lynch VJ.

        "Second, scRNA-seq data, in general, are much more variable than bulk data. scRNA-seq data typically include a higher level of technical noise (such as dropout events), but also reveal much of the biological variability that is missed by RNA-seq on pooled cells. Biological variation is present on many levels, and which of these are considered as nuisance variation depends on the underlying biological question being asked. For example, at the gene level, transcriptional bursting causes variation in transcript quantities [[67](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR67 \"Suter DM, Molina N, Gatfield D, Schneider K, Schibler U, Naef F.

      "paragraphs": [
        "Over the past 6 or so years, there has been an explosion of interest in using scRNA-seq to provide answers to biologically and medically related questions, both in experimental animals and in humans. Many of the studies from this period either pioneered new wet-lab scRNA-seq protocols and methodologies or reported novel bio-informatic and computational approaches for quality-controlling and interpreting these unique datasets. Some studies also provided tantalizing glimpses of new biological phenomena that could not have been easily observed without scRNA-seq. Here, we consider what the next 5 years might hold for scRNA-seq from the perspective of clinical and experimental researchers looking to use this technology for the first time.",
        "Given that the field of single-cell genomics is experiencing rapid growth, aside from being confident that numerous advances will be made, exactly what these will be remains difficult to predict. Nevertheless, we point towards various areas in which we hope and expect numerous advances to be made. First, most scRNA-seq studies have tended to examine freshly isolated cells. We expect many more studies will explore cryopreserved and fixed tissue samples using scRNA-seq, which will further open up this technology to clinical studies.",
        "As isolation of single cells is of paramount importance to this approach, we expect more advances in wet-lab procedures that rapidly dissociate tissue into individual cells without perturbing their transcriptomes. In addition, while many scRNA-seq studies have employed expensive hardware, including microfluidic and droplet-based platforms, future studies will reduce costs by further reducing reaction volumes, and perhaps also by avoiding the need for bespoke pieces of equipment [[38](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR38 \"Rosenberg AB, Roco C, Muscat RA, Kuchina A, Mukherjee S, Chen W, et al. Scaling single cell transcriptomics through split pool barcoding. In BioRxiv. 2017. \\n          https://doi.org/10.1101/105163\\n          \\n         .\")]. Currently, much of the cost associated with conducting a scRNA-seq study is associated with cDNA library preparation and NGS. Given ongoing trends for decreasing sequencing costs, we anticipate that these cost benefits will also make scRNA-seq more affordable on a per-cell basis. This will likely drive another trend—the ever-increasing number of cells examined in a given study. While early studies examined a few hundred cells, with reduced costs and the widespread adoption of newer droplet-based technologies, we anticipate that analysis of millions to billions of cells will become commonplace within the next 5 years [[96](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR96 \"Svensson V, Vento-Tormo R, Teichmann SA.

With the accumulation of such enormous datasets, the issue arises regarding how to use them to their full potential. Many researchers would without doubt benefit from centralized repositories where data could be easily accessed at the cellular level instead of just sequence level [[97](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR97 \"Ner-Gaon H, Melchior A, Golan N, Ben-Haim Y, Shay T.

        "Next, as mentioned above, the ‘drop-out’ problem that occurs even in high-resolution scRNA-seq datasets illustrates that weakly or even moderately expressed genes can be missed, partly owing to the currently modest efficiencies for mRNA capture. We expect that mRNA capture rates will continue to improve over the next 5 years, to an extent where perhaps almost all mRNA molecules will be captured and detected. This will permit more-sensitive analysis of gene expression in individual cells and might also serve to reduce the number of cells required in any given study.",
        "Given the unique analytical challenges posed by scRNA-seq datasets, we expect great advances in bioinformatic and computational approaches in the coming years. In particular, user-friendly, web-browser-like interfaces will emerge as gold-standard packages for dealing with scRNA-seq data. These will contain all the necessary functionality to allow researchers first to QC their data and then to extract biological information relating to heterogeneity, the existence of rare populations, lineage tracing, gene–gene co-regulation and other parameters.",
        "Recent studies are providing exciting possibilities for combining scRNA-seq with other modalities. For instance, the use of CRISPR–Cas9 genome-editing techniques alongside barcoded guide RNA species has allowed high-throughput assessment of gene function in single cells [[98](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR98 \"Adamson B, Norman TM, Jost M, Cho MY, Nuñez JK, Chen Y, et al.

We expect that many new combination approaches will emerge using proteomics, epigenomics and analysis of non-coding RNA species alongside scRNA-seq (reviewed in [[100](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4#ref-CR100 \"Macaulay IC, Ponting CP, Voet T.

We speculate that the next decade will take us closer to a truly holistic examination of single cells, which takes into account not only mRNA, but also the genome, epigenome, proteome and metabolome.",
        "Finally, we believe that several clinical applications will emerge for scRNA-seq in the next 5 or so years. For example, resected tumours might be routinely assessed for the presence of rare malignant and chemo-resistant cancer cells. This information will provide crucial diagnostic information and will guide decisions regarding treatment. Next, as an extension to a full blood count, scRNA-seq assessments will provide in-depth information on the response of immune cells, which again will inform diagnoses and the choice of therapy. Finally, the relatively small numbers of cells present in a range of other tissue biopsies, for example from the skin and gut mucosal surfaces, will be ideal for providing molecular data that informs on diagnosis, disease progression and appropriate treatments. Thus, scRNA-seq will progress out of specialist research laboratories and will become an established tool for both basic scientists and clinicians alike."

        "This decade has marked tremendous maturation of the field of single-cell transcriptomics. This has spurred the launch of numerous easily accessible commercial solutions, increasingly being accompanied by dedicated bioinformatics data-analysis suites. With the recent advances in microfluidics and cellular barcoding, the throughput of scRNA-seq experiments has also increased substantially. At the same time, protocols compatible with fixation and freezing have started to emerge. These developments have made scRNA-seq much better suited for biomedical research and for clinical applications. For example, the ability to study thousands of cells in a single run has greatly facilitated prospective studies of highly heterogeneous clinical samples. This can be expected to have a profound impact on both translational applications as well as our understanding of basic tissue architecture and physiology. With these increasing opportunities for single-cell transcriptome characterization, we have witnessed remarkable diversification of experimental protocols, each coming with characteristic strengths and weaknesses. Researchers therefore face decisions such as whether to prioritize cell throughput or sequencing depth, whether full-length transcript information is required, and whether protein-level or epigenomic measurements are to be performed from the same cells. Having clearly defined biological objectives and a rational experimental design are often vital for making an informed decision about the optimal approach."
